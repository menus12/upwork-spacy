The user\\password they have has not worked since the IP address has changed.\nWant to see if you can help troubleshoot?\nThe app developer is no longer around &ndash; it was before us, but a very messy court case from what I understand.\n==============================\nHere is my initial response: \nMatt, \nI dug around a bit and I do see that the application login with the new IP is functional, or at the very least, present. The forgot password is the obvious, but if the email address is no longer valid then that would be a useless endeavor. The good news is that you have access to the server, files, and databases. I am more familiar with the WordPress environment and so I have had to go into a database and inject my own username and password. I don&#039;t know exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp;that would look like for your customers&#039; issue, but the process should be fairly similar.\nCreating an administrative login directly in the application involves modifying the application&#039;s database or its config files. This is where it gets fuzzy for me as I am not familiar with the applications architecture, its database schema or what programming language is being used in the app. So the process is going to vary significantly. With that in mind, here is a general approach. \nFirst, you need to familiarize yourself with the application&#039;s file structure so that you can find where the config files are located. You need to understand the authentication logic, and where the database connection settings are located. For databased in WP which uses PHP, I look for config.php but it might be something like .env, database.php, settings.py, (for Django) config.rb (for Ruby on Rails), config.json, or config.js, database.js (for Node.js Applications), or appsettings.json (for ASP.NET Core Apps). \nNext, you will want to identify the database that stores the access credentials. When you find the configuration file that houses the database connection settings take note of the database type, the host, the port, the database name, and ultimately the username and password. \nFrom here you will want to use the credentials you find to connect to the database using a DB management tool or command-line interface, something like phpMyAdmin for MySQL, pgAdmin for PostgreSQL, or MongoDB Compass for MongoDB. \nOnce you are connected to the database you will need to locate the table where the user account information is stored. It should be named something like &#039;users&#039;, &#039; accounts&#039;, or &#039;admin_users&#039;, something like that. Make note of the structure of the table, especially the columns that have the usernames, password hashes, roles, or permissions. \nThen you will want to insert a new record into the user table with administrative privileges. If the passwords are stored as hashes (which they should be if the security is good), you&#039;ll need to generate a hash of the password you wish to use. There are a ton of tools and libraries for this online. Generating a password hash will require some understanding of the hashing algorithm being used by the app (ex. bcrypt, SHA-256, etc...). \nFinally, Test the new login. Hopefully you will have administrative access!\nI did a quick search for an example of the SQL query. If the application uses an SQL database it might look something like this:\nINSERT INTO users (username, password, role) VALUES (&#039;newadmin&#039;, &#039;hashedpassword&#039;, &#039;admin&#039;);\nReplace &#039;hashedpassword&#039; with the actual has of your password and adjust the table and column names as per the apps schema. \nOf course, you will want to be sure to back up your database before making changes just in case you need to restore. \nI hope this information is helpful. I have done it a time or two before, but it was for WordPress website. Depending on the apps architecture and coding language these instructions may be rendered useless, but the similarities will exist regardless. \n========================================\nMy client does not have time to mess with it, nor do I at the moment, and I don&#039;t know if I could even if I wanted to. I was hoping to outsource the solution and need a quote, if you can.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to do is have you investigate the situation and provide a solution for my client&#039;s client. \nThank you so much.\n-Nick<b>Skills</b>:        Python,                     JavaScript,                     MySQL,                     PHP,                     jQuery,                     Amazon Web Services,                     Database Architecture            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Admin-Locked-Out-Application_%7E01ce52812be5f92d17?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:52:56.174Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 27, 2024 20:47 UTC","id":"01ce52812be5f92d17"},{"skillset":["Web Application","AI Development","AI App Development","Python","Amazon Web Services","RESTful API","Stable Diffusion"],"title":"Launch ComfyUI Python App in Cloud - Upwork","description":"I have a python app that uses a comfyui backend to transform images.

Once you begin the survey, you have up to 72 hours to complete it, beyond which time the survey platform will mark your responses as incomplete. Please pay attention to all the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSince many established resources for employees such as organizational support or supervisors do not apply to freelancers, this study intends to help freelancers with strategies to have a better freelancing experience on Upwork or other comparable platforms. We will use your answers to guide new and experienced freelancers on building their profiles on labor platforms like Upwork and managing their freelancing career, as well as suggest improvements to the platforms and to policymakers. If you are interested, we can provide you with a brief summary of our major findings from our completed research study once our research is complete (tentatively August 2025 or earlier), after contacting you via Upwork.\nWe welcome freelancers across experience levels, earnings, and ratings who:\n(i) provide freelancing services on their own (not as part of an agency or company),\n(ii) are over 18 years of age,\n(iii) have provided freelancing services for more than 1 year on Upwork,\n(iv) have worked on freelancing projects in the past 1 year on Upwork (consider July 2022-June 2023 as the past 1 year), and\n(iv) have a Job Success Score on their profile.\nIf you meet all the criteria listed above, please respond to this online survey job posting only if you consent to participating in this survey and allowing us to use certain details from your public Upwork profile for statistical purposes.\nProcedure: In this survey you will not have any more risks than you have in normal life. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board.\nYou will not be personally identified in our analysis or reporting. While storing the data from the survey, a participant ID number will be used instead of your name. However, we will collect some information from your public Upwork profile with your consent (e.g., ratings, job category, total earnings, number of jobs, number of successfully completed jobs and jobs in progress, hourly rate, pricing strategy (fixed vs. hourly), profile title and keywords, number of reviews, type of recognition badge, number of years of educational and work experience, number of skill tags, country, gender, job success score, availability of&nbsp;&nbsp;portfolio, testimonials, certifications, availability badge, and profile video) to understand the difference in freelance experience. Profile information that is captured from your public profile on Upwork with your consent, will be depersonalized for data analysis and reporting so that it is not identifiable with your details and will only be recorded against your participant ID number. These details and your responses will be kept confidential and used for academic purposes only. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board. Data will be stored in a secure academic database on university-licensed cloud storage to ensure confidentiality.\nPlease use a laptop or tablet to complete the survey. We recommend not using mobile.\nCompensation: You will receive $8 for your participation. Kindly note, you will be compensated upon completion of the entire interview as per standard Upwork processes. At the end of the survey, you will be provided with a random ID number (numerical code) that will need to be shared with us on Upwork Message. This will enable us to process your compensation via the Upwork platform, as per standard Upwork processes.\nYou can stop participating in the survey at any time.

Users can explore different apartments within a building through a 360-degree movement interface. The service highlights apartments upon mouse hover, enhanced by image overlays. Our challenge is accurately mapping out each apartment&rsquo;s location and visibility from various camera points within a 2D environment, considering the 3D model complexities and the impossibility of viewing the back of the building in a 2D render.\nHere is the example: https://www.egnahemsbolaget.se/projekt/selmagard/\nObjectives\nWe seek a skilled MAXScript developer to create a script (or series of scripts) that accomplishes the following:\nCamera View Analysis: Determine which parts of apartment mesh layers are visible from each camera position in 3ds Max.\n2D Projection: Accurately project the visible 3D mesh parts onto a 2D plane corresponding to the camera&rsquo;s view for integration into our web service.\nData Export: Export the visibility data and 2D projections in a web-friendly format for use in our apartment-picker interface.\nKey Tasks\n1. Visibility Check Script: Develop a MAXScript that iterates through specified cameras, analyzing which apartment meshes are visible from each viewpoint. This analysis should account for the camera&rsquo;s frustum and any occlusions by other building elements.\n2. 2D Projection Logic: Implement logic within the script to project visible portions of the apartment meshes onto a 2D plane. This step is crucial for identifying the exact areas in the 2D rendered image where each apartment is located.\n3. Data Handling: The script must exclude non-visible mesh parts, considering the 3D model&rsquo;s orientation and the limitations of a 2D environment.

This document outlines the specifications for the application&#039;s development, including the required features, functionality, and user interactions.\n### Development Specifications\n#### Core Features\nAn existing Godot app that can load and display 3D CAD models will be provided so that it can be expanded with the following features. \n1. **Clipping Planes:**\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Users must be able to generate a clipping plane that intersects the 3D model.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The clipping plane should be alignable to a model surface as specified by the user.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The intersection should result in a visual cut through the model, allowing the user to inspect the internal structures.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The user is able to manipulate the clipping plane by translating and rotating.\n2. **Measurement Tool:**\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A feature to measure the distance between two points on the model is required.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The result should display the distance and project this distance onto the major axes (X, Y, Z) for easy reference.\n3. **Tagging and Metadata:**\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Users should be able to tag different parts of the mesh and add metadata to these tags.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The application must support adding markup comments. These comments should be displayed in a bubble with an arrow pointing to the tagged location.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Users should have the option to display or hide the comments.\n4. **Saving and Loading:**\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The application must allow saving the current state, including the imported 3D CAD model, clipping plane data, and any markup comments/metadata, into a single file and in a specific file format.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Other users must be able to open and load these files using the same application to view the CAD models and associated metadata as saved by the original user.\n#### Technical Requirements\n- **Development Environment:** Godot 4.\n- **Language:** GDScript or C# (depending on the developer&#039;s expertise and the project requirements).\n- **External Libraries:** Use of external libraries or plugins for CAD file parsing and manipulation must be clearly documented and comply with their respective licenses.\n#### User Interface\n- The application should have a clean, intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to import models, create clipping planes, measure distances, and add tags or comments.\n- A toolbar or menu system should provide quick access to the main features.\n- Visual cues or tooltips should be used to guide the user through the application&#039;s functionality.\n#### Documentation and Testing\n- Include a developer guide with details on the project structure, external libraries used, and extension points for future development.\n- The application must be thoroughly tested on Windows.\n#### Deliverables\n1. Source code with detailed comments and adherence to coding standards.\n#### Timeline and Milestones\n- The project timeline and specific milestones will be determined in consultation with the developer based on their estimate of the effort required for each feature.<b>Skills</b>:        C#,                     Godot,                     CAD,                     Shading Language,                     Windows App Development            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Godot-CAD-Model-Review-Application-Development_%7E010ff8dede138e083c?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:53:08.093Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 26, 2024 14:38 UTC","id":"010ff8dede138e083c"},{"skillset":["C++","Windows App Development","Desktop Application"],"title":" Windows dialog with OpenGL window - Upwork","description":"We need a simple app in Windows compiled with Visual Studio which&nbsp;&nbsp;can open a dialog from then main men&uacute; with a small window showing a triangles mesh of random size between 500 to 2000 and chaging Z values( can be random values or a periodic funci&oacute;n) , object need to be able yo be rotated with the mouse and zoom it, also on the dialogue we need options to change theobject tender from wireframe to solid and change color of the object or just to invert it.<b>Skills</b>:        C++,                     Windows App Development,                     Desktop Application            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Windows-dialog-with-OpenGL-window_%7E01f31ac43c60152b60?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:53:08.093Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: January 17, 2024 11:13 UTC","id":"01f31ac43c60152b60"},{"skillset":["Personal Computer","Game Prototype","Unreal Engine","Game Design","Animation","Video Game Software"],"title":"Unreal Engine Video Game Dev Team - Upwork","description":"We are a studio interested in creating proprietary software/plug-in for Unreal Engine.\n- Using Unreal Engines Metahuman, we would like to create a Facescan generator similar to NBA 2K. Where through a series of facial uploads from a Phone App, players can upload a series of necessary photos to get a realistic character mesh. \n- The facial scan can also be used to create Morphs into other forms. Players can transform to other entities like morph into different species and lifeforms. \n- Would need to be able to upload photos via a phone app. Player would upload multiple photos from multiple angles on a clear background. Player would also have to select/highly key-points on the face like where each eye, nose, mouth area is to help the engine transform the photoscan into the a 3D model for Unreal Engine properly. \nEssentially, we are trying to streamline a quick and more efficient process of the Mesh to Metahuman process shown in the 2 videos below. The process takes around 20-30 minutes and requires someone manually going from app to app to clean up and do alot of groundwork. We need to create a process and software that streamline this process and makes it more user friendly and quick as uploading the necessary scans via Phone App and letting the software on our end do the legwork. It can take as much processing time as needed, but we don&#039;t want the users having to do the work outside of uploading their scans:\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN5zf-2iteY&amp;amp;ab_channel=MaxNovak\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFk_WU32igA&amp;amp;ab_channel=MR3D-Dev\n//\nAdditional References: DAZ 3D FACE TRANSFER \n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3EpWG_6eac&amp;amp;ab_channel=W3Productions\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8x2sFd6WxI&amp;amp;ab_channel=W3Productions\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVizpsU6J90&amp;amp;ab_channel=FreedomArts-3DAnimation%26GameDeveloper\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYF-ezNjjVE&amp;amp;ab_channel=SolomonJagwe\n2K FACE SCAN\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n41EDyW7NSQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=iPodKingCarter\nWe also want the possibly to use things like DAZ3D Morphs to transform Humanoid characters into other life form characters like Aliens, Goblins etc. BUT keep there unique facial structure when morphing.

This approach will help in loading and processing data in the background, improving user experience by keeping the interface responsive. Lazy loading is particularly critical for ensuring that only the necessary parts of the app are loaded and processed as needed, which is crucial for optimizing performance and resource usage on mobile devices.\nBackend Efficiency: For backend operations, we&#039;re looking at using caching and queue systems for managing long-running tasks such as video processing. This strategy is crucial for optimizing resource use and maintaining app speed.\n.5 Batch Video Processing: An important aspect of the app will be its ability to process video data in small batches.

I have a VERY rough sketch of the website, but the developer who takes on this project will need an entrepreneurial mindset to read the Miro Mindmap and then develop the features. I want to make this very clear, the mindmap (Miro.com) will be the primary source of direction. While I will provide rough sketches on Figma, screenshots, and similar/competitor websites for ideas, the miro mindmap should be considered the core guidance, with everything else supplemental. I have thorough github issues listing the features and what they entail, as well as github discussions to explain functionality, but you will need the abilty to understand the feature, then design it, and then implement the code. While UI/UX design isn&#039;t the primary focus, the ability to develop a website without wireframes or Figma designs is crucial. Candidates with UX design skills will be prioritized, as it eliminates the need for a separate UX designer later on. The pay will reflect the added skillset. The website will need to be viewed on mobile and desktop.\nThe website primarily focuses on data representation, featuring numerous tables and charts. User authentication is managed through a self-hosted installation of AppWrite (that you will setup on the server provided), with data sourced dynamically from MongoDB and PostgreSQL for charts and tables using AppWrite Functions. Therefore, comfort with data manipulation and display is essential. \nData collection is automated through scripts, leaving the primary task of the developer to focus on data presentation from the databases. The website will be employing many/all strategies to prevent scraping. You will also need to be familiar with anti-scraping techniques, and server-side-rendering. I don&#039;t want people to be able to &#039;inspect elements&#039; and then be able to extract data.\nThis contract pertains to the initial version of the website, with opportunities for future engagements involving feature enhancements, maintenance, and more.\nDue to the project&#039;s complexity, we expect inquiries to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements outlined herein. We prioritize candidates who can comprehend the full scope of the project and its intricacies. Your proposal should thoroughly understand the scope of this project, and show it. Answering one word answers to questions, or using ChatGPT will not suffice.\nFinal Deliverables:\n1. Code repository uploaded to GitHub (provided post-contract acceptance)\n2.

Then script should select the best magic numbers according to few conditions (profit factor is main criteria and minimal number of trades) and save these in an output text file (just magic numbers as comma separated list). \nFor better understanding please visit https://www.fxblue.com/users/btc_lab/stats and click on Strategy subtab. There is a sortable table with performance metrics on each trading system that will be place to take data from, filter by some conditions and save result in output txt file.\n1. Input file will have just few comma separated magic numbers - so script will load txt and at start only filter all data to these few ones at each execution of script.\n2. There will be&nbsp;&nbsp;base conditions to filter: minimal number of trades and minimal profit factor saved as variables inside script - if input file magic numbers/strategies match these criteria, save them in output txt file as comma separated list and finish task of script (each execution just write this as only line erasing file before so not adding new line but all content in that txt is one actual output line).\n3. Important: there have to be also two crucial variables to config inside script:\na) number of saved magic numbers in output file to specify - if set to 1 it will just save one, best strategy magic number from input list based on highest profit factor value (in case of actually having two strategies with exact same best PF select one with more trades), if set to 2 save two magic numbers with best PF etc\nb) number of days to look back - for example if set to 30, all filtering will be done only on performance data from last 30 days till today\nExample (can be not exactly valid over next days as I write it now, performance data will change but you get the idea) - we need 2 best performers (variable1) based on PF from last 30 days (var2), with minimal of 20 trades (var3) made in this period and minimal PF of 2.20 (var4):\n1. On mentioned https://www.fxblue.com/users/btc_lab/stats go to Strategy subtab to see all table\n2. Script input txt file content is as follows:\n10631413,31089143,31631384,41709668,11264203,10817499,10818040,11082329,11255314,13301217,10645531,22074309,10856171,11694325,10821383,11405135,21585815,11893048,12482165,11231421\n3. Script will take profit factor values for mentioned strategies from last 30 days as var2 (notice Filter button on right where you can set last 30 days filter and it change URL on website to filter that, same way you can filter for magic numbers) to look for two best ones.\n4. According to var3 and var4, we have five candidates passing criteria: 10631413,41709668,11264203,13301217,22074309\n5. Based on highest PF then, two best (because of var1) are 10631413,41709668 and that as a result will be just single line saved to output txt file by script (file is cleared at each save so new line replaces old one, whole file is just new up to date one line comma separated list).\n6. In case no strategy/magic number matches criteria (like not having enough trades or minimal profit factor), save blank file.\nThats all what is needed to do by this script. Important detail that have to work is to make variable2 (number of days to look back) working with exact numbers like I want to set 53 days back so script have to filter data from exactly 53 days, not only presettings that FX Blue gives at its filter button).\nMentioned fx blue account (btc_lab) is example and separated copies of script will run for other accounts - I guess this url will be also defined in script so can be edited.<b>Skills</b>:        Trading Automation,                     Forex Trading,                     Python,                     Data Scraping,                     Data Mining,                     Scrapy,                     Data Extraction,                     Quantitative Analysis,                     Scripting            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Python-script-for-quick-filtering-Blue-strategy-magic-number-based-data_%7E017f622d09e0892fda?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:55:15.232Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 12, 2024 19:07 UTC","id":"017f622d09e0892fda"},{"skillset":["PHP","WordPress","Web Development","WordPress Plugin"],"title":"Edit a wordpress plugin - Upwork","description":"Setup &amp;amp; edit plugin : peepso &mdash; https://demo.peepso.com/\nTasks:\nChange color/text/placement of some containers.\nTransfer content from main site to this plugin.\nAdd additional pages to sidebar menu (like events tab/job list tab)\nConfig blog stream as new home page, and I want to customize what people see here.\nConfig the existing function&rsquo;s naming (tab name)\nAdd google display add to the blog stream\nIntegrate woocommerce function (digital marketplace) for the brand profile &amp;amp; product review function.<b>Skills</b>:        PHP,                     WordPress,                     Web Development,                     WordPress Plugin            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Edit-wordpress-plugin_%7E016bcea301cbd67fad?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:55:15.232Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 12, 2024 18:21 UTC","id":"016bcea301cbd67fad"},{"skillset":["JavaScript","AngularJS","Node.js","C#","jQuery","Vue.js",".NET Framework","D3.js","ASP.NET Web API","Angular 5"],"title":".net and AWS  - Upwork","description":"Hey!

Many selectors are used to pass data to container components.\n- Actions are used to trigger state changes.\n- Effects are used to handle side effects, such as loading data.\nBackend\n- Backend is 100% based on firebase Firestore.\n- Angular Fire is used to handle the connection to Firestore.\n- The interaction with the backend is done through services, that are called from side effects. RXJS is used to handle the data flow.\n- All data models are defined in a shared folder, that is used by the front end and the backend.\nAuthentication\n- Authentication is done using Firebase Authentication.\n- Each salesman is automatically assigned to a user with a backend Cloud Function, and that user receives a salesmanId that is passed to the user token.\nThe Project\nWe need an Expert Angular Developer that has experience with Angular, NGRX and Firebase to perform the tasks below.\n- Refactor the current app with best practices and clean code, regarding Angular, NGRX, RXJS, Firebase and all other technologies used.\n- Update Angular, NGRX, RXJS and all other technologies used to the latest version.\n- While refactoring, the developer will create unit tests using Jasmine and Karma, and e2e tests using Cypress, with the goal of achieving 100% test coverage.\n- The developer will also create a CI/CD pipeline, that will run the tests and deploy the app to Firebase Hosting.\n- Refactor the generic-table component so that it can be used to display the data in the way we expect, we want to use this same component on all the features to display tabular data.\n- It is expected that after the refactoring, the app will be bug free and will have a better performance.\n- We expect this project to take 1 month to be completed.\n- The developer must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to ensure the confidentiality of the project.\nThe purpose of this code refactoring is to make the code more maintainable, scalable and readable. We want to make sure that the code is following best practices and that it is easy to understand and maintain in the future.\nLong term goals\n- We intend to add many other features to the CRM on the near future, not only for internal salesmen, but also for managers, administrators, and external salesmen that would need to access on mobile devices.\n- We also intend to use this same stack to develop many other apps for internal company use, on other domains, such as Transportation, Stock Management, Financial Management, etc, for internal use and for clients.\n- All of these apps will be used for our company, but we have plans to sell them as SAAS products in the future.\n- We want to hire an Expert Developer with extensive experience with the stack we are using, that is willing to work with us on the long term on many other projects.<b>Skills</b>:        Angular Material,                     RxJS,                     Jasmine,                     Angular,                     Firebase,                     Cypress            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Angular-Code-Refactoring_%7E0121eef93b7178534d?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:55:21.359Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 11, 2024 18:22 UTC","id":"0121eef93b7178534d"},{"skillset":["Microsoft Power BI"],"title":"PowerPages &amp; PowerBI Integration Consultation - Upwork","description":"We are seeking an expert consultant to provide a few hours of consultation on achieving PowerBI integration onto PowerPages.

If you feel confident in doing any one part of this but not the entire project please let me know that as well. I am not against hiring a team to do this and completing in stages if need be.\nJob Description:\nI am looking to integrate multiple platforms to create a streamline system for our operations. The platforms are Readymode, GHL, Ring Central, Fireflies.Ai, Google Sheets, &amp;amp; Plecto.\nI am looking to integrate the Readymode dialer platform to GoHighLevel to auto transfer details from contact information on the data to the contacts in GHL. \nThis needs to be done when an call is marked in Readymode as Set Appointment- when this happens it will go into a Round Robin Style Calendar in GHL with the First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone number, address, city, state, zip code,&nbsp;&nbsp;utility bill amount readily available to be seen in the new contact created and appointment set in GHL.\nIn GHL I need a full project management pipeline with various stages of deal progression as our solar projects progress from sold deal to install. I want to drag and drop these manually as they move along through the natural progression. It would be nice to send out automated texts and emails to the number and email listed for each contact as they are moved from one stage to the next to keep the customer in the loop.\nIf the appointment is marked as a no show they will go to a drip campaign to nurture the lead via text and email. They will also receive an immediate link to reschedule another appointment on our calendar.\nWhen an appointment sits with our sales team we need a link with Appypie to connect the call recordings done via Ring Central to store the call recording attached to the contact made in GHL. This will be used with Fireflies.Ai to automatically transcribe the call to voice to text and easily review calls to coach reps and see insight into what occured during the interaction.\nAfter a appointment is closed or demo&#039;d and not sold&nbsp;&nbsp;we want to automatically send out a customer satisfaction survey to the contact number &amp;amp; email on file to assess sales persons performance. \nIt will need to be integrated with a google sheet automatically to update with call results as well. (Not mandatory)\nAs the project moves forward on the project management pipeline from booked appointment to other stages it will automatically need to be updating our leaderboard in Plecto to provide real time insight into what is happening for our team. There will be two leaderboards one for appointment setters and one for closers.

Companies like ARRI, RED, Sony, and Cannon are all starting to make immersive cameras that can capture content in 180 and 270 degrees in formats such as Apple Immersive Videos which is a 180-degree 3D 8K recording format captured with Spatial Audio. \nI need the best estimate for what the Total Addressable Market is for this category. Ideally, the research would arrive at a ballpark set of figures projected for the next 1-5 years. This estimate would be the total volume (sales dollars or unit qty) of Cameras that capture Spatial/Immersive Video in ~2025 (one year) and beyond up to 2030 potentially; this would be across Professional market and Consumer market (consumer market would be things like GoPro, professional market would be things like ARRI). \nAlso I need a breakdown of specific forecasts for individual camera manufacturers (like ARRI, RED, Sony, Cannon, and others). \nThis would be a volume (sales dollars or unit qty) of their specific camera offering that capture Spatial/Immersive Video in ~2025-2030 across Professional and Consumer.\nHere is a possible framework to use in doing this research: \nCalculating the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for companies that produce immersive video cameras, such as ARRI, involves understanding the scope of the market these companies are targeting. The TAM represents the overall revenue opportunity available for a product or service if 100% market share were achieved. For immersive video cameras, which are often used in filmmaking, broadcasting, virtual reality (VR) productions, and increasingly in sectors like education, corporate training, and real estate, this requires a multi-faceted approach.\nHowever, specific dollar figures require current market data, trends, and access to comprehensive market research reports, which can vary year by year. As of my last update in April 2023, here&#039;s a framework to understand how you might approach determining the TAM for immersive video camera producers:\nIdentify the Key Markets:\nFilm and Television Production: This includes major film studios, independent filmmakers, and television production companies.\nCommercial and Advertising: Businesses creating commercials and branded content.\nLive Events and Sports Broadcasting: Companies that specialize in capturing live events, concerts, and sports.\nEducation and Training: Organizations using immersive video for educational purposes or to train employees.\nReal Estate and Architecture: Firms leveraging immersive video to offer virtual tours or visualize architectural projects.\nVR Content Creation: Entities focused on creating content specifically for VR platforms.\nMarket Research and Reports:\nLook for industry reports related to each of these sectors, focusing on the adoption and investment in immersive video technologies. These reports often provide market size, growth projections, and insights into consumer and business demand.\nIndustry Growth Factors:\nConsider how trends like the growth of virtual and augmented reality, the increasing demand for high-quality video content across digital platforms, and technological advancements in camera technology might expand the market.\nGeographical Considerations:\nThe TAM should reflect global opportunities, taking into account regional variations in market adoption and investment in technology.\nHistorical Sales Data and Future Projections:\nAnalyze historical sales data of immersive video cameras and related equipment. Combine this with industry growth rates to forecast future sales.\nTo give a rough example, if research suggests that the global film and video market is projected to grow to $X billion by a certain year, and immersive video technology is estimated to capture Y% of that market, you could calculate a potential TAM for immersive video cameras in that segment. Repeat this process across the other identified sectors and sum them up for a comprehensive TAM.\nRemember, the accuracy of your TAM calculation depends on the reliability of your data sources and the assumptions you make regarding market penetration and growth. Given the rapidly evolving nature of technology and media consumption habits, these factors can change, necessitating regular updates to your market analysis. <b>Skills</b>:        Market Research            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Total-Addressable-Market-Analysis-for-Immersive-Video-Cameras_%7E018ba7c546f1d790bc?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:57:05.491Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 14, 2024 23:42 UTC","id":"018ba7c546f1d790bc"},{"skillset":["Writing","Market Research","Online Market Research","Information Analysis"],"title":"Market Researcher and Writer for Educational Publishing Reports - Upwork","description":"We are seeking an experienced market researcher and writer with knowledge about the education industry, specifically edtech and/or educational publishing to write and/or contribute to our comprehensive reports. \nThe ideal candidate should have explicitly researched and written full market and industry reports.

This is especially true for the UK as the forecast for oat milk is +40% growth over the next 5 years. With that said, oat milk in the shape we currently know is not the best at the moment. Firstly, because people currently buy oat milks that are actually made from 90%+ water for a crazy price of around GBP 2.50 to 3 per litre. Each bottle of milk usually has only 2-3% of oat, making the drink very liquid, tasteless and again incredibly expensive for water. Secondly, most people only use a dash of milk in their coffee/tea, but the shelf life of these bottles is very short leading to product waste. Also, buying many bottles is a lot of packaging that ultimately ends up in our household waste. \nWhy an oat milk base? With all the above in mind, our idea is to bring a new way of consuming oat milk. With our oat milk base, people will actually be able to buy what they should pay for. Our base will be made from 90%+ of oat and be low in oil with a minimum of adding water. This base will allow people to dose their milk and adapt it to their taste depending on how much water they want to add per spoon, making their milk stronger in taste or lighter depending on what they want. Additionally, this base is versatile, again depending on the water they add they should be able&nbsp;&nbsp;to create oat creams and make their favourite savoury dish or cakes. The other USP is the shelf life, this base will have a long shelf like (app 1 year), drastically limiting waste of the product but also waste of packaging since one pot of our base will be equal to 7 liters of oat milk (so here we are also reducing packaging waste by 7 times). Of course, we know that coffee shops are important in our culture, and this base will be barista ready, allowing coffee shops to use and to froth their oat milk to perfection. Finally, it goes without saying that our product will be as natural and as local as possible, using the best ingredients we can find across Europe and providing customers with a high quality product mindful of the people, planet and animal.<b>Skills</b>:        Science,                     Scientific Writing,                     Food &amp; Beverage,                     Food,                     Research &amp; Development,                     Food Engineering,                     Content Writing,                     Product Development            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Oat-milk-base-product-development_%7E01d83aad0a7594f932?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:57:05.494Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 05, 2024 20:05 UTC","id":"01d83aad0a7594f932"},{"skillset":["Inventory Management","Logistics Management","Demand Planning","Forecasting"],"title":"Demand planning  - Upwork","description":"Hello\nLooking for someone with demand planning expertise to assist on a part-time basis. \nResponsibilities would be inventory management and accurate order forecasting along with working with our warehouse partners.\nExpertise in this area is a must, and experience with Dynamics Business Central is a plus.\nWorking EST time zone.\nLikley 2-4hrs/week to start<b>Skills</b>:        Inventory Management,                     Logistics Management,                     Demand Planning,                     Forecasting            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Demand-planning_%7E012c2cd4bff0f5a1b8?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:57:05.494Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: January 31, 2024 01:09 UTC","id":"012c2cd4bff0f5a1b8"},{"skillset":["Quantitative Research","Market Analysis","Business Analysis","Data Analysis","Marketing Analytics","Market Research","Competitive Analysis"],"title":"Startup App Market Analysis &amp; Growth Strategy\n - Upwork","description":"GoLingo, a pre-launch language learning app, seeks to assess its market potential and growth strategy without the need for an elaborate financial forecast.

We use several payment gateways including Takepayments and WooCommerce Payments. We do not and WILL NOT use page builders on the site with the exception of the ones already available using blocks from Generate Press.\nMobile users generate 80% of our sales but for these users the checkout process is difficult and slow. We want to add Google &amp;amp; Apple Pay Checkout buttons as well as Paypal Express for all device types and we want these added under the first step of the checkout funnel beneath the safeplace entry box. The website uses Funnel Builder and the Store Checkout feature which is accessed via the Wordpress menu. Obviously we will be needing conversions to be tracked if these payment methods are used.\nThe site is tracking conversions with GTM but not all conversions originalting from Google Ads appear to be tracked. Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager implementations need auditing and checking especially after adding express pay buttons.\nThe tracking set up in GTM tracks most purchases but is missing some and we are not quite sure why but one possible issue may be that Paypal users are not being tracked as they pay and do not return to the site to view the Order Completed page. Another issue may be with the Takepayments gateway. Both of these need to be checked as to operation and effect on tracking. Most purchases are recorded so it is not a problem affecting every sale but rather the tracking event somehow not getting triggered for some sales. It is important as it affects our Google Advertising metrics. Here is a link to clarity as an example of an order placed and not tracked.\nhttps://clarity.microsoft.com/shared/recording/e3227c92-abf8-4b2f-a517-b6bf84dd240e\nPlease let me know if you think you can hanlde both of these tasks to solve the issue and propose a fee for the work.<b>Skills</b>:        PayPal            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Woocommerce-Add-Express-Pay-Buttons-amp-Audit-GTM-Tracking_%7E010e5fb8c72fdab5fb?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:57:28.505Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 16, 2024 13:24 UTC","id":"010e5fb8c72fdab5fb"},{"skillset":["WordPress","Web Development","Web Design","Payment Gateway Integration","Payment Functionality"],"title":"Payment integration for WordPress website - Upwork","description":"I currently have a WordPress-developed website where people can take online exams.

This includes moving all the goodies - our products, the customer info, and historical orders. It&#039;s super important to me that we keep the shop&#039;s current vibe and performance steady as she goes throughout this process.\n2. **Clever Redirects for the Second Store**: I&#039;ve got another webshop, but for this one, I&#039;m thinking we just keep the domain and redirect it to the new Shopify store.

We&#039;re talking smooth sailing with 301 redirects to keep our online presence strong and uninterrupted.\n3. I need also Shopify template that mirrors the essence of our current Zencart setup. It needs to be easy to navigate, and, of course, designed to keep clients interessted in our store.\n4. **Don&#039;t Leave Anything Behind**: It&#039;s not just about products and policies. I want to make sure all our core content, like our &amp;quot;About Us&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Terms and Conditions&amp;quot;, makes the jump too. Keeping our story and the fine print intact is key to staying true to our brand and our customers.\nWhat I&#039;m looking for in a developer is not just skills and experience, but someone who gets the importance of maintaining our store.

(it would be great to show the raw, un-watermarked images in a users profile for example)\nIf not, then i guess it would need to be a private bucket, that my website requests a image from when it needs to be downloaded?\nAny advice and help writing this policy would be great!\nBest,\nJames<b>Skills</b>:        Amazon Web Services            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Help-creating-bucket-IAM-ACL-for-AWS-bucket_%7E01c098d93d6a7eefae?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:58:03.699Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 25, 2024 09:16 UTC","id":"01c098d93d6a7eefae"},{"skillset":["Finance &amp; Accounting","Odoo","Odoo Development","PostgreSQL","ERP Software","Python","JavaScript","Customer Relationship Management","Enterprise Resource Planning","Database"],"title":"Odoo Consultant - Upwork","description":"we are looking for expert odoo consultant for our company&#039;s ERP<b>Skills</b>:        Finance &amp; Accounting,                     Odoo,                     Odoo Development,                     PostgreSQL,                     ERP Software,                     Python,                     JavaScript,                     Customer Relationship Management,                     Enterprise Resource Planning,                     Database            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Odoo-Consultant_%7E01acb08c497669d3b3?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:58:03.699Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 24, 2024 13:33 UTC","id":"01acb08c497669d3b3"},{"skillset":["Java","API","JavaFX","API Integration"],"title":"API integration with java/JAVAFX Intellij - Upwork","description":" so iam developping an application i have a problem i dont know how to integrate api&nbsp;&nbsp;so i have a tast user i did all the work related to the user entity i need to add in the login page an sms api to send the user his username and password when he forget them using his phone number and i want to add a login with google&nbsp;&nbsp;and a captcha in the login page&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be a quick work dm ur proposal and i will give you the&nbsp;&nbsp;folder project plus the database and this should be done quickly in max 2 days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thhanks <b>Skills</b>:        Java,                     API,                     JavaFX,                     API Integration            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/API-integration-with-java-JAVAFX-Intellij_%7E018ca7d3bcfe9ec67b?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:58:03.699Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 21, 2024 17:32 UTC","id":"018ca7d3bcfe9ec67b"},{"skillset":["Amazon Web Services","Linux System Administration","System Administration","HIPAA","MySQL","Network Security","Network Administration","Amazon EC2","PHP","JavaScript"],"title":"AWS HIPAA Server System Admin - Long Term USA or Central America Location - Upwork","description":"This is a Paid Per month Support Contract \nFxMedSupport is a cutting-edge med-tech company developing an innovative app that connects patients with healthcare professionals.

This includes setting up your ROS environment, developing your application&#039;s components as ROS nodes, and ensuring that these components communicate effectively to perform the intended functions. Here&#039;s a structured approach to demonstrating your implementation:\n1. Define Your System&#039;s Architecture\nIdentify Components: Break down your system into key components, such as sensor data acquisition (ECG, accelerometer, gyroscope, PPG), data processing (e.g., particle filter algorithm), decision-making (emergency response, daily assistance tasks), and user interface.\nDesign ROS Nodes: Plan which parts of your system will be implemented as separate ROS nodes. For example, each sensor might have its own node for data collection, and another node might implement the particle filter for data analysis.\n2. Set Up the ROS Environment\nInstall ROS: Choose the appropriate ROS version (ROS 1 or ROS 2) for your project and install it on your development machine or robot&#039;s onboard computer.\nCreate a ROS Workspace: Set up a workspace where you&#039;ll develop your project&#039;s packages.\n3. Implement ROS Nodes\nSensor Nodes: Implement nodes that interface with each sensor to collect data. These nodes will publish sensor data using ROS topics.\nProcessing Node: Develop a node that subscribes to the sensor data topics, applies the particle filter algorithm (or any other analysis algorithms), and determines the system&#039;s response based on the processed data.\nAction Nodes: Create nodes responsible for taking actions, such as sending alerts, communicating with emergency services, or controlling robotic mechanisms to assist the user.\nUser Interface Node: If your system includes a user interface, develop a node that allows users to interact with the system, configuring settings, and receiving notifications.\n4. Integrate and Test\nIntegration: Ensure that all nodes are correctly integrated, subscribing to the necessary topics, and communicating as expected.\nSimulation and Visualization: Use tools like Gazebo for simulating your robotic system and Rviz for visualizing sensor data and the robot&#039;s actions. This is crucial for testing your system in a controlled environment.\nTesting: Conduct thorough testing to ensure reliability, including handling sensor noise, responding to emergency conditions, and interacting with the user.\n5. Demonstration\nPrepare Your Demonstration: Plan a demonstration that showcases how your robotic assistance system can help people with disabilities. This might include simulated scenarios that highlight the system&#039;s responsiveness to falls, health emergencies, or daily assistance tasks.\nLive Demonstration: Use your ROS setup to run the system in real-time, potentially employing a robot or a simulated environment to show the system in action. Demonstrate how sensor data is collected, processed, and how the system responds to different conditions.\n6. Documentation and Explanation\nDocument Your Work: Provide clear documentation on how your system is designed, how each component works, and how to set up and run your system.\nExplain During the Demonstration: As you demonstrate the system, explain the role of each component, how data flows between nodes, and how decisions are made and executed within the system.\nFinal Notes\nShowing an implementation in ROS, especially for a complex system like robotic assistance for people with disabilities, requires careful planning, development, and testing.

Once Greengrass Core is installed on a PC and the cloud connection exists, it is possible to push &amp;quot;Greengrass components&amp;quot; from the cloud and run them in the background without user interaction. I will use this to push components that are Python scripts. This is why AWS Greengrass Core needs to be installed as a background task and why the installer must include Python.\nThe requirement for this project is that the installer is a single file (.exe or .msi) that I can double click to install all four parts mentioned above. The installer should ask me in which folder I want to install all parts (probably in `C:\\Programs Files`). The installer must also ask me to upload three files (see below for details). When the installer is done, AWS Greengrass Core must be running on my Windows PC. When I restart the Windows PC Greengrass must automatically start.\nI don&#039;t care how you implement the installer as long as it works on the current versions of Windows. From my research I understand that &amp;quot;WiX Toolset&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;InnoSetup&amp;quot; are popular choices. If you want to use software that has a license cost you must ask me before proceeding (I will probably say yes but want to look at it first).\nThe following are details about the different parts that need to be installed:\nAWS Greengrass Core\nYou can read about Greengrass in general here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html\nThe installer basically needs to complete the steps described in this documentation as &amp;quot;manual install&amp;quot;: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/manual-installation.html#run-greengrass-core-v2-installer-manual\nBasically, there are some setup steps and then this command must be run: \njava -Droot=&amp;quot;C:\\path\\to\\greengrass\\v2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;-Dlog.store=FILE&amp;quot; ^\n&nbsp;&nbsp;-jar ./GreengrassInstaller/lib/Greengrass.jar ^\n&nbsp;&nbsp;--init-config my-custom-config-file.yaml ^\n&nbsp;&nbsp;--component-default-user ggc_user ^\n&nbsp;&nbsp;--setup-system-service true`a\nAs you can see, this requires Java and a config file. Let&#039;s talk about these next.\nJava\nCorrect me if I&#039;m wrong, but it&#039;s probably best if I include a copy of Java in the installer. I want to use some version of OpenJDK and think Amazon Corretto is the best choice: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-21-ug/downloads-list.html \nConfiguration file\nThe documentation for how to install Greengrass has an example of the configuration file. The file contains the folder path to Greengrass in a few places. Only the installer knows what this path is, so it needs to put this path into the file. Some other information in the config file is stuff the installer does not know by itself, for example &amp;quot;iotDataEndpoint&amp;quot;. So I propose that the user uploads an incomplete configuration file, then the installer adds the folder paths.\nCertificate and private key files\nThese are two files that every user will have. I can generate two for you for testing if that&#039;s needed. Note that the configuration file contains the path where these are stored, make sure the installer actually puts them into this place.\nPython &amp;amp; C Redistributable\nFind the &amp;quot;Windows installer (64-bit)&amp;quot; for the most recent release of Python 3.11 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

These members come in three categories, Kids, Teens &amp;amp; Adults and may be a combination of each. There needs to be two access levels created. They are:\n1. Kids - who can view kids material.\n2. Teens/Adults - who can view teens/adults material.\nMy members are about 100 atm and they are required to come and register on the homepage. \nOnce they register, it triggers an email to us to check and moderate. It also triggers an email to the member to say we will approve it soon as long as it is legitimate. We approve based on whether they are legitimately a member. \nOnce we approve this triggers an email to let them know they have access. If it does not succeed, it sends them a message saying that membership was not successful and to try again and email us if there are any issues.\nAt the next stage, the member can then login to the website. Ensure accessibility on all devices. When they log into the website, they will have a bigger area where they land (currently at least on desktop this area is very minimal), this is the dashboard. \nThe dashboard should have some videos in there, such as &#039;Latest Additions&#039;, &#039;Club News, and some information. I want to be able to make the entry look nice. It would be good if there was a video of me here, welcoming people even. I would like to potentially use this area to upsell other courses and products (physical items even like gloves and such), and to be able to update. It is basically a dashboard, a landing page and a place to update people on news and new courses and products and additions.\nThe left hand menu for now has the correct info, the PDF CURRICULUMS page is for our levels and topics. I need a nice way to show the file here and then have them download it - it is too small on desktop. It probably doesn&#039;t need document manamagement, but we could consider a plugin. OR just make a visually appealing way to view and download. We would need to track everything too. For Kids access, we have two PDF files at the moment. For teens/adults access, Practitioner, we have 5 PDF files at the moment.\nThe next page Video Library needs to show the curriculum videos. For kids, it will be first White to Blue topics which I can show you on a pdf, and then a lot of videos for Brown material. \nWhen they visit this page it needs to be a nice layout with a way for them to watch whatever video they like. I want to be able to track how much they watch and treat it like a course to get through, especially for public courses, but in this case it doesn&#039;t matter if they are just listed without need to measure progression. \nThe kids page initially will need to have White to Blue Belt videos. The brown belt videos can wait. For adults, it&#039;ll need to be Practitioner 1 videos first, then P2, then P3. We need to start with the first levels at least from presentation point of view. Need to decide if we use a learning based system.\nThat&#039;s it for now. But once we finish, I want to start looking at offering the above courses to the public. I want to then extend with new courses and have them offered to the public AND to my members. At this stage the members will get access to everything we make that is for the public.\nEssentially, I need someone to create the elements of the page, which then allow me to go in and enter in vimeo or youtube links, for the videos. And in general, I want to simply be able to have placeholders that are visually appealing for the PDF stuff, and then for the video pages too. But with videos, we need a generic block that I can click and enter the url.\nIf there are things I am not considering, feel free to discuss it. This is a pretty simple project for the moment, but it just needs to consider what we might do down the road.\nI also have different categories of programs coming, like Masterclass, etc, etc. But I think this is faily straightforward. \nI need to find someone who can just scope this out effectively and do it.<b>Skills</b>:        WordPress,                     Learning Management System,                     Elearning,                     CSS,                     Web Development,                     Web Design            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Tutor-LMS-Setup-and-Modifications-ACL-for-Learning-Site_%7E01a87a6e6e1005bb57?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:58:43.796Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 11, 2024 23:38 UTC","id":"01a87a6e6e1005bb57"},{"skillset":["Computer Skills","Data Entry","Microsoft Excel","Administrative Support","Accuracy Verification","English"],"title":"Data Entry For Business Use Of Vehicle KM's Driven Log Book  - Upwork","description":"Hello, we are in need of someone to create company vehicle daily log kilometers driven jounrals/log books in excel format. \nThese log journals will be for 3 vehicles driven daily for a duration of 1 year. \nData gathering will be completed using &amp;quot;maps&amp;quot; and inputting property address&#039; provided by us to you, gathering distances travelled to and from our business location to a specific property address, address to address, then km driven returning to the starting property address. \nAll km driven will be tallied for a total years worth of km driven.

Each dashboard runs in a containerized app that is forwarded by a proxy server (see www.haruspice.com/app_3000/).\nThe entire project will be realized in different phases. The first phase&rsquo;s aims to setup account creation, separation of accounts such that each user has access to his containerized dashboards and such that apps are secure (only one user account has access to the app). This requires setting up a mechanism of authentification into wordpress that also authentificates user in the NGINX reverse proxy to serve the containerized apps.\nCurrently, www.haruspice.com is powered by wordpress and hosted on AWS with Amazon lightsail. The website is served behind an NGINX reverse proxy which is also used to redirect users to containerized dashboards. While the use of NGINX and containers to serve content is a must, the use of wordpress to manage logins, account creation and (later) payments is not necessary obliged and other software can be suggested. \nProjects Goals (phase 1):\n1) Set up Account creation with a redirection to a &ldquo;my account&rdquo; page scpecific to each user.\n2) Use the authentification mechanism in wordpress to authentify the user on the NGINX reverse proxy.

The hot fluid will be used to drive a binary cycle power plant at the surface.\nKey Responsibilities:\n1. Review the project concept and gather necessary data on the local geological conditions, geothermal resource characteristics, and existing well information.\n2. Develop a detailed model of the single-well geothermal system, including the well configuration, heat exchanger design, and fluid circulation parameters.\n3. Perform thermodynamic and fluid dynamic calculations to estimate the heat transfer rate, fluid temperature, and flow rate at the wellhead.\n4. Evaluate the potential power generation capacity of the system based on the wellhead energy and the efficiency of the binary cycle power plant.\n5. Identify potential technical challenges and risks associated with the single-well design and propose mitigation strategies.\n6. Conduct a preliminary economic analysis of the project, considering capital costs, operating expenses, and potential revenue from electricity sales.\n7. Prepare a comprehensive feasibility report summarizing the technical findings, energy output estimates, economic analysis, and recommendations for further development.\nRequired Qualifications:\n- Bachelor&#039;s degree in mechanical, civil, or petroleum engineering, or a related field (e.g., geophysics, geological engineering).\n- Minimum of 5 years of professional experience in geothermal energy projects, with a focus on system design, modeling, and analysis.\n- Strong knowledge of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer principles applied to geothermal systems.\n- Experience with geothermal reservoir modeling and simulation software (e.g., TOUGH2, FEFLOW, CMG STARS).\n- Familiarity with binary cycle power plants and their integration with geothermal heat sources.\n- Excellent analytical, problem-solving, and project management skills.\nPreferred Qualifications:\n- Master&#039;s degree or Ph.D. in geothermal engineering, renewable energy, or a related field.\n- Experience with closed-loop geothermal systems or single-well designs.\n- Professional certification, such as the Certified Geothermal Designer (CGD) credential.\n- Membership in geothermal industry organizations (e.g., Geothermal Resources Council, International Geothermal Association).\nDeliverables:\n1. Detailed model of the single-well geothermal system.\n2. Calculations and estimates of the heat transfer rate, fluid temperature, and flow rate at the wellhead.\n3. Assessment of the potential power generation capacity at the wellhead.\n4. Identification of technical challenges, risks, and mitigation strategies.\n5. Preliminary economic analysis of the project.\n6. Comprehensive feasibility report with technical findings, energy output estimates, economic analysis, and recommendations.\nIf you are a passionate and experienced Geothermal Engineer excited about the opportunity to evaluate this innovative single-well, low-cost power generation concept, we encourage you to apply.

It is part of the broader SOC framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to help organizations assess and communicate their control environments to customers, regulators, and other stakeholders.\nHere are key points about SOC 1 reports:\n1. **Purpose**: SOC 1 reports are specifically designed for service organizations that provide services that could impact their clients&#039; financial statements. These services might include processing financial transactions, managing payroll, or providing other outsourced services related to financial reporting.\n2. **Type 1 vs. Type 2**: There are two types of SOC 1 reports:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Type 1**: Reports on the fairness of the service organization&#039;s presentation of its controls at a specific point in time.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Type 2**: Reports on the effectiveness of the service organization&#039;s controls over a period of time, typically covering at least six months.\n3. **Control Objectives**: SOC 1 reports focus on control objectives related to financial reporting. These objectives ensure that the service organization&#039;s internal controls are designed and operating effectively to mitigate the risk of material misstatements in their clients&#039; financial statements.\n4. **Scope**: The scope of a SOC 1 report includes a description of the service organization&#039;s system and the controls implemented to achieve the specified control objectives. This description is typically provided by management and is assessed by an independent auditor.\n5. **Audience**: SOC 1 reports are primarily intended for the service organization&#039;s customers and their auditors. They help customers evaluate the adequacy of controls in place to support their financial reporting requirements and may be requested as part of the due diligence process or regulatory compliance.\n6. **Report Components**: A SOC 1 report typically includes:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A description of the service organization&#039;s system and the services provided.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Management&#039;s assertion about the effectiveness of controls.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The auditor&#039;s opinion on the fairness of management&#039;s assertion.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Details of any control deficiencies or exceptions identified during the audit.\nIn summary, SOC 1 reports are essential for service organizations that handle financial data for their clients. These reports provide assurance to customers and stakeholders regarding the reliability and security of the service organization&#039;s controls related to financial reporting processes.<b>Skills</b>:        English,                     SOC 1            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/SOC-Analyst-amp_%7E01a5f8b0222c79a385?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:00:15.634Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 15, 2024 16:44 UTC","id":"01a5f8b0222c79a385"},{"skillset":["Graphic Design","Presentations","Communications","Content Writing","Data Entry"],"title":"Development of Orientation Documents for Startup Nonprofit - Upwork","description":"We are a startup nonprofit in need of a skilled individual to assist us with developing orientation documents, Google forms, and other communications for our board members and volunteers.

Although this job is pretty straight forward if you show us you can handle other projects we are more than willing to hire you for other jobs as well.

There is strong potential for additional work on an ongoing basis if the right candidate is found. \n**Scope:** The project involves three primary tasks. You will be working independently on these tasks.\n1. **Task 1 - Lead list enrichment:** Starting with 50 email addresses captured from content downloads and a Google Sheets template, you will build a lead list. Emails captured will be forwarded to your email inbox. Example email and spreadsheet shown below.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Upwork 001.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e203070b-21f8-4184-9c5b-65a422b95070/09d8509b-e3dd-4400-9add-054d8b4b8554/Upwork_001.png)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Upwork 002.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e203070b-21f8-4184-9c5b-65a422b95070/db504bdd-d4b2-4f55-aeaa-b5a945ae7703/Upwork_002.png)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- You will be responsible for finding the prospect&rsquo;s name and LinkedIn account based on their email address. We recognize that this task is not possible for all prospects because a small portion of them will not have a LinkedIn account or enough public information on social media to confidently identify them. Thats OK! Just do your best and be sure you only add names and LinkedIn profiles to the spreadsheet if you are extremely confident they are accurate.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- You will also be responsible for filling out the following fields in each spreadsheet entry:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Week Of: Monday&rsquo;s date for the current work week.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cohort: a value you will be given on a per job basis\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Related content: selection from a dropdown associated with the piece of content the prospect downloaded. This information is in the emails you will be forwarded.\n2. **Task 2 - Email drafting using templates:** Starting with a set of email templates for each piece of downloadable content, you will draft emails to each prospect in the spreadsheet. Emails will be drafted in a single Google Document. **Important: You will not be sending emails to any candidates during the entirety of this project.** You are solely responsible for developing draft emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Google Doc that you will be using looks like this.\n![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e203070b-21f8-4184-9c5b-65a422b95070/6d0853e0-4893-43c7-8770-ccf60b0280d6/Untitled.png)\n**Note:** Be sure to use the format in the Google Doc so that emails can be easily converted into my Gmail account.\nThe Google Document will also include the email templates with guidance on where and how to personalize or customize the emails for each prospect.\n1. **Task 3 - Lead qualification and data cleanup:** Starting with a CSV export from Taplio, you will review each lead in the spreadsheet and qualify or disqualify them based on clear criteria (exact criteria will be shared in the spreadsheet). The initial spreadsheet will include 101 prospects for evaluation. Please clearly mark which prospects are qualified and which are disqualified. Please add the qualified prospects to the spreadsheet used in Task 1 and update the &lsquo;Cohort&rsquo; field to &lsquo;Taplio&rsquo; for each prospect copied over. <b>Skills</b>:        Data Entry,                     Lead Generation,                     Email Marketing,                     Administrative Support,                     Email Communication,                     Scheduling            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Marketing-virtual-assistant-needed-for-lead-management_%7E014a6c1dd009b6feaa?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:00:27.340Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 13, 2024 19:33 UTC","id":"014a6c1dd009b6feaa"},{"skillset":["Web Development","WordPress","Ecommerce Website Development","Web Design"],"title":"Build E-commerce website  - Upwork","description":"Responsibilities:\n&bull;\tWebsite Development and Design:&nbsp;&nbsp;Build and design a responsive, visually appealing e-commerce website that aligns with our brand identity.

The program should offer a range of features to enhance accuracy, speed, and overall performance without the risk of in-game death.\nOne essential feature is the inclusion of timers to track the duration of each key bind. These timers should seamlessly integrate into the program&#039;s interface to avoid interrupting gameplay. They will provide valuable insights into performance and areas for improvement.\nAdditionally, the program should display the exact keys required for each key bind. This feature will facilitate learning and memorization of key combinations during gameplay.\nThe program must have a highly intuitive and user-friendly interface. It should be effortless to input preferred key binds and monitor progress. Simplicity is key, allowing players to focus on the game without unnecessary complications. Customization of key binds should also be possible.\nWe are excited about finding a program that revolutionizes the way we learn and master key binds in our game. The program should include ability icons, accurate timers, visible keystrokes, and customizable key binds. A user-friendly interface is paramount.\nFurthermore, we require the program to randomly send key binds or practice specific rotations either after a certain amount of time or in a random order. It is crucial that the key bind entries align with the game&#039;s timing system, with the timer adjusting in &amp;quot;ticks&amp;quot; of 0.6 seconds per tick.\nThe program should also offer the ability to toggle individual key bind inputs, ability icons, and sound muting. Players should have the flexibility to choose between icons only, sounds only, key bind inputs only, or any combination thereof.\nTo aid in the development of this program, we are willing to create a new account, purchase a membership for that account, and grant the programmer access. This will allow them to reference, test, and obtain icons. We will also provide access to the game&#039;s official wiki page, which contains technical information such as the timing system and global cooldown.\nThe program can be developed in one of three stages of completion:\n1. Empty Program:\n- Create a functional program that incorporates all the mentioned features.\n- The program should be able to utilize all the features.\n- This stage of completion would be during or directly after the initial testing phase of the program.\n- This my preferred level of completion. This would ensure a quicker completion while allowing myself to test everything to locate any and all bugs that would require your attention.\n- I will have ample time to test, log any bug(s), and interact with all of the features. \n- If I found any bugs/issues I would collect evidence in the form of written notes, screenshots, videos etc. providing you all the information for a speedy debug phase if any.\n- I take the functional program and complete the setup myself. To test the functionality and get accustom to the UI incase I want to change/add anything.\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;I acquire, resize, and add the ability/function icons to a library. \n- I add all of the sound clips on a one to one ratio,\n- I assign all of the key binds, etc.\n2. Partly Filled Program:\n- Expand the program to include ability icons from the 4 combat styles and the 2 universal styles (defensive, constitution).\n- Approximately 140 named icons should be included.\n- This would be the next stage of preferred completion allowing myself still a fair amount of time to test, log any bug(s), and setup all of the customizable features.\n3. Filled Program:\n- Extend the program to encompass every possible ability icon from all 4 combat styles, 2 universal styles, and non-combat functions such as food and potions.\n- Well over 250+ ability/function icons added to a &amp;quot;library&amp;quot;, ability names, 250+ individual sound clips should be included.\nThe User-Friendly UI should feature a resizable screen window and include the following desired functions:\n- Select User: Allow users to personalize settings, key bind loadouts, rotations, and more.\n- Create User Profile: Enable users to create individual profiles with specific settings, key bind loadouts, speeds, rotations, etc.\n- Add Key Bind: Provide the option to create new key binds or modify existing ones to be added to the randomized pool.\n- Add Rotation: Allow users to determine the order in which key binds appear in a rotation. Customization options such as time limits, allowable mistakes, and progression settings should be available.\nThe creation of new key binds should include the following features:\n- An interactive keyboard representing a full-size keyboard.\n- Keys associated with existing key binds should be locked or blacked out.\n- The ability to add a prefix, such as &amp;quot;Shift,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ctrl,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Alt,&amp;quot; to key binds.\n- Options to include pictures or colors for quick identification.\n- The ability to name each key bind.\n- The option to attach sound to each key bind.<b>Skills</b>:        Game Design,                     Python,                     Game Design Document,                     Game Development,                     C#            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Game-Keybind-Learning-Program_%7E019e77ceab7fd45aad?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:00:27.341Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 03, 2024 23:18 UTC","id":"019e77ceab7fd45aad"},{"skillset":["Spreadsheet Automation","Google Sheets Automation","Google Sheets","Microsoft Excel"],"title":"Need a google sheets person right now for 1-3 hour - Upwork","description":"I have built a moderately complex spreadsheet .

Its main function is to guide users through often transformative or complex support journeys (sustainability, digitalization, employability). More information at copilotpro.co.\nThe software application is used by various companies in different sectors. \nThis software application consists of a back end (called the cockpit) and a front end (referred to as the &amp;quot;user space&amp;quot; or more simply as the &amp;quot;roadmap&amp;quot;).\nThe application is used by three target audiences, each with their own specific use:\n- Administrators can autonomously create a complete support experience with simple drag-and-drop tools. For this, they use the back end.\n- End users follow the support deployed by the administrators, so they can progress step by step and record this advancement. They use the front end.\n- Managers (an &amp;quot;optional&amp;quot; group because they are not mandatory) generally manage a group of users in the context of digital/human hybrid support (e.g., a business creation advisor who has several companies). They use the front end.\nA support journey is materialized by the user&#039;s roadmap. This roadmap is the central element of our interfaces; it is also our unique and different creative and visual asset (our goal is therefore to improve it and continue to make it our identity marker).\nThe roadmap consists of the following elements:\n- The mission: it is the &amp;quot;unit&amp;quot; of the support we offer, and it can take several forms:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;o Elearning\n&nbsp;&nbsp;o Step-by-step guide\n&nbsp;&nbsp;o Certification\n&nbsp;&nbsp;o Collective challenge (future feature)\n- The question: it allows posing a question to personalize the content that follows, and it also serves to block the display of content below to prevent visually &amp;quot;overloading&amp;quot; the roadmap.\n- The call to action: it highlights a short action (clicking a link, etc.) that does not require multiple steps.\n- The info bubble: It highlights a short piece of information (often a video or a short text) without necessarily requiring action, so it is informative.\nActions:\n1. Modernization of the back office design (goal: a single design identity between back and front). Pages to work on: (see appendix 3)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Roadmap page (with blocks)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Page with a table (for example, the accounts page)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Analytics page.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Page for adding a badge\n2. Modernization of the front office design (without changing UX), with the goal of making it a little less &amp;quot;stark&amp;quot; (very few images/cold currently).\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Roadmap (plan to add &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot; for each mission, for example for MED to write: &amp;quot;valid for&amp;quot; &amp;quot;B Corp&amp;quot;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.

Upon completion of an exam, the recorded video undergoes a conversion process to render it playable.

In such instances, the transmission of video frames may become out of sync, resulting in corrupted video files. As a result, we must reconvert these files and attempt to recover them for proper functionality.\nAt present, our conversion process achieves success rates of 65%, with the remaining 35% of videos encountering conversion failures. Usually, it&#039;s because of missing headers.\nCurrent Issues:\nNaN &amp;amp; Undefined files get created when there are connection issues on the student&rsquo;s PC.

Was it a natural market correction or were there specific catalysts driving the appreciation?\nResearch Goal:\nThe overarching goal is to pinpoint historical epochs analogous to the current market conditions and assess if those lower market segments are likely to experience gains larger than the general market. By rigorously analyzing past trends while controlling for external factors, the study aims to provide insights into the likelihood of repressed markets normalizing upwards compared to the national average.\nScope and Limitations:\nThe study will focus on real estate markets in the continental US with populations exceeding 50,000. although if data is more easily accessible, analysis on a county level could also be entertained.\nExternal factors such as industry shifts will be excluded from the analysis to isolate the impact of price disparities.\nThe research will aim to hold as many variables constant as possible to ensure the validity of comparative analyses.<b>Skills</b>:        Market Research,                     Research Methods,                     Real Estate Financial Modeling,                     Economic Analysis            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Comparative-historical-real-estate-research_%7E01a40d0c8e20c50a60?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:00:33.203Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 21, 2024 01:15 UTC","id":"01a40d0c8e20c50a60"},{"skillset":["Customer Service","Data Entry","Relationship Management","Zoom Video Conferencing","Lead Management"],"title":"Part-Time Technology Sales Support Specialist (Remote) - Upwork","description":"Company Overview:\nAt Neo Code Software, we are pioneers in crafting custom software solutions, with a keen focus on FileMaker and bespoke web application development.

I need you to upload the file to a 3rd party platform (i.e. bunny.net.) Any fees associated with being on the 3rd party platform will be either added onto your payment, or if you just let me know which platform it will be, I will buy the membership and give you the login.\n2. We need to use a platform in which people cannot watch the video for free. The way it works on the website currently is people will buy/rent the film and then they will be redirected to the &amp;quot;watch now&amp;quot; page that that they cannot access unless they pay for the film. Something like vimeo or youtube will not work because they could just get the link for free.\n3. We need to keep the process the same as it currently is. When they click &amp;quot;buy now&amp;quot; and purchase the film, they need to be redirected to the &amp;quot;watch now&amp;quot; page the same way they currently are, but then to have the film play through the 3rd party plugin instead of the direct website upload as it currently is. I don&#039;t want anything about the website to change aside from the 3rd party plugin (i.e. customers wouldn&#039;t have any idea anything changed if they went back and watched the movie again.)\n4. I want to make it so that anyone who has previously bought the film and has been guaranteed permanent access to still have access to the film, despite the 3rd party plugin now being used. <b>Skills</b>:        WordPress,                     WooCommerce,                     Web Development            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Needed-ASAP-Video-word-press-site-move-3rd-party-platform-and-not-affect-prior-purchases_%7E0142949e3a1f818d07?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:00:56.821Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 16, 2024 19:43 UTC","id":"0142949e3a1f818d07"},{"skillset":["Web Service","Business Logic Layer","C#","API","RESTful API","Software Architecture &amp; Design"],"title":"Looking for intermediate backend developer: flexible schedule - Upwork","description":"Greetings,\nWe are in search of a intermediate backend developer to join our dynamic team.

Example - on the home page, we are unable to add in new content such as client logos. We are unable to add some association logos to the footer. This site uses a Mapbox integration that sometimes does not seem to work. \nWebsite 2 (www.CPOMP.org) - need to build out a portal (accessed by login) with some content for members only. This includes a sort of &amp;quot;ListServ&amp;quot; where members should be able to send communication to specific groups of people within this portal. The portal doesn&#039;t seem to work well at this time so we need to improve it. Most pages on the site are also slow. This site uses the Divi theme. We primarily use Gravity Forms and Stripe integrations. \nWebsite 3 - We are planning to build a very simple website for a new software program we have developed. We just need a couple pages with some background and case studies, and the ability to lead to the login of our software program.

We are a central hub uniting a global community in the fight to confront the challenge of coral reef degradation through coral restoration activities around the world. The CRC needs a website that not only serves as a beacon for coral restoration efforts but also establishes a foundation for CRC&rsquo;s ongoing digital presence and community engagement. \nDesign Requirements: The website will encompass 19 pages, with 17 existing and 2 new ones to be designed. The design should align with the CRC brand guide, with an emphasis on searchability, ease of navigation, and showcasing CRC products. The design needs to prioritize accessibility and be as user-friendly as possible in multiple languages. The CRC values a clean, engaging, and easily navigable design, taking inspiration from websites such as animalsintheroom.org. \nContent Management System (CMS) Requirements: The website must incorporate a user-friendly CMS for ongoing updates, exclusively using Wix as both the platform and the CMS of choice. \nExisting Website Assessment: A thorough evaluation of the existing website (crc.world) is required, focusing on a collaborative reorganization of the existing site map, and redesigning existing pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Content will mostly remain unchanged, and new copy has already been created, so no new copy is needed from the designer, unless an SEO analysis indicates some light copy revisions may be necessary. \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\nScalability:&nbsp;&nbsp;The website should be designed with scalability in mind to accommodate continuous additions of new products, such as webinars and whitepapers. \nProject Support and Communication:&nbsp;&nbsp;The CRC team seeks 2x/week status updates and wishes to maintain open communication through emails and weekly video calls to ensure project alignment. \nTimeline:&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is to be completed within a month, structured as below. This schedule is potentially flexible for the right candidate and can be discussed during the hiring process.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWeek 1: Initial design concepts. \nWeeks 2-3: Design revisions. \nWeek 4: Final implementation and handover of deliverables. \nBudget:&nbsp;&nbsp;The total budget for this project is $3500. Should additional services require a revision of the budget, proposals should clearly indicate this.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nEvaluation Criteria:&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals will be assessed based on the following criteria, with each aspect being crucial to the selection of the successful candidate. In your proposal, please address each of these criteria directly, providing specific examples or case studies where applicable. Our selection process will involve a comprehensive review of how each proposal meets these criteria. \nFlexibility with Clients: Demonstrated ability to adapt to feedback and changes during the project lifecycle. Please provide examples of past instances where you had to show flexibility in meeting client needs. \nAttention to Detail: We expect a keen eye for detail to ensure all aspects of the website design and functionality are meticulously crafted and implemented. Candidates should provide evidence of this skill with references to specific elements in their portfolio. \nIntuitive Eye for Design: The ability to create designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitively navigable for users from diverse backgrounds. Proposals should include design samples that showcase this talent. \nExperience with Wix: Given our requirement for the Wix platform, extensive experience with Wix website development, including the use of its CMS, is essential. Please detail your history with Wix, including the number of projects completed and any particular features of the Wix platform you have utilized. \nAlignment with CRC&rsquo;s Mission, Cultural and Market Sensitivity\nPortfolio Quality, Project Plan Clarity, Creative and Innovative Approach, Budget Adherence, Sustainable Design Considerations, Compliance, and Security Proficiency\n**Should the designer have a background in creating custom illustrations, we strongly encourage them to include those details in the proposal. **\nProposal Submission:&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals should include a portfolio, preliminary project plan, experience with accessible and SEO-friendly design, and confirmation of availability to meet the project timeline.

Ideally, these algorithm should be executed once when a user first loads the web app, and then the processed data should be stored on the back end without any loss, thus allowing the posts to be simply &lsquo;fetched&rsquo; when needed. Instead, the algorithm is currently being &lsquo;called&rsquo; with each user action, causing several sorting errors, sometimes losses and sometimes duplicates, and unwanted results. \nWhat was already done:\nNote that there was already a (failed) attempt to fix this issue by creating a backend API that serves the purposes of sorting all results (at intervals of 30 mins) in such a way that users would just pull those results when &#039;loading&#039; more posts or comments. Unfortuntaely, the other contractor who worked on this approach fell short of offering a solution for a few reasons (miscommunication, errors along the way). We thus need someone who is at least intermediate-advanced (if not expert) on this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nScope:\nThis job will be short because the front-end is already handled, the collections are created, and the sorting algorithms are all done, ready to be &#039;connected&#039; to the API.

You can do this using custom code in your theme&#039;s functions.php file or by using a plugin like Custom Post Type UI.\nAdd Custom Fields:\nFor the &amp;quot;Racers&amp;quot; custom post type, add a custom field to store the racer&#039;s information. You can use plugins like Advanced Custom Fields to easily add custom fields to your post types.\nCreate Race Pages:\nYou&#039;ll need a template to display race pages for each racer. You can create a custom page template for this purpose. This template will display information about the race and the specific racer&#039;s details.\nAuto-generate Race Pages:\nTo auto-generate race pages for each racer, you can use a combination of custom code and hooks. When a new racer is added or when a new race is created, you&#039;ll hook into the appropriate actions to automatically generate a race page for each racer.<b>Skills</b>:        WordPress Plugin,                     WordPress,                     WordPress Website,                     WordPress e-Commerce,                     Web Design,                     WordPress Multisite,                     PSD to WordPress,                     WordPress Migration,                     WordPress Security,                     WordPress Customization,                     WordPress Consultation,                     WordPress Landing Page,                     WordPress Theme,                     Wordpress Thrive Themes,                     WordPress Development            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Can-you-work-today-Asap_%7E01f83a746e6ac2b04c?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:02:47.240Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 23, 2024 03:12 UTC","id":"01f83a746e6ac2b04c"},{"skillset":["Web Application","API Integration","React","Figma to Webflow Plugin","Web Development","Mobile App Development","Payment Functionality","Flutter"],"title":"Build mobile optimized webapp with payment/booking functionality - Upwork","description":"Looking to create a mobile optimized web-app based on a complete figma prototype.

You will then apply lighting and texturing. When it is done, your scene will consist of a lit and colored car sitting on a lit and colored road next to a lit and textured stop sign, illuminated by a lit and colored streetlamp.\nPart 1-1: Setting your Scene\nThe first step is to review the starter code for this project. It contains a Model and a Face class and a series of calls that take in OBJ and MTL files and parses them into Model objects. Make sure you understand what this code is doing and what it returns so that you know how to use it in your program. You are welcome (but not required) to make any modifications to this code that you see fit. If you see any errors in this starter code or have any suggestions for improvement, let the instructor know.\nThe starter code produces several console.log() statements that allow you to look at everything that has been processed from the files. You should study these statements to understand how the data in the Model class is organized. In particular, node how Model has an array of Face instances that contain all of the vertices, normals, and texture coordinates for each face in that model. The faces have all been triangulated for you, so you can just pass them directly into the vertex shader (either one face at a time or all at once) to draw your mesh using gl.TRIANGLES. Each face also has a corresponding material field that references one of the materials in the diffuseMap and specularMap fields in Model. You can use this information to look up the appropriate values for your lighting calculations on that face.\nOnce you are comfortable with the above information, you should then render your models in a simple view to verify that your program is working. (HINT: Start with the stop sign, since it&#039;s the simplest mesh.) You will then want to set up your scene as shown in the demo video (you will incorporate the bunny in a later step). Once everything is set up correctly, you should then turn your attention to the MTL files.\nDiffuse colors in the form &ldquo;Kd [R] [G] [B]&rdquo;\nSpecular colors in the form &ldquo;Ks [R] [G] [B]&rdquo;\nA diffuse texture map in the form &ldquo;map_Kd [Map Image]&rdquo;\nPart 1-2: Lighting\nNext, you will place a point light at the top of your streetlamp to illuminate your scene. Your light should use Phong shading, and you should use the previously loaded diffuse and specular material colors from the MTL file. You may create your own ambient color.\nAllow the user to press the &lsquo;L&rsquo; key to toggle the light on/off, but make sure that ambient light is still applied to your scene even when the light is off.\nImplementation Notes:\nYour lighting will likely look flat simply due to the normals on the provided models not being smoothed.\nPart 1-3: Texturing\nNext, you will implement texturing in your program using the texture coordinates loaded from the stop sign&rsquo;s OBJ file, accompanied by the stop.png texture as specified in the map_Kd attribute of the material in stopsign.mtl.\nImplementation Notes:\nThe texture coordinates in the OBJ file are flipped along the Y-axis; to get your final texture coordinates, you should subtract the V coordinates from 1.\nPart 1-4: Camera Animation\nFinally, you will implement basic camera animation so that the user can view your scene from different angles. When the user presses the &lsquo;C&rsquo; key, make the camera move along a circle on the XZ plane, while bobbing up and down slightly (along the Y-axis) as shown in the demo. (HINT: Think about how you might use the trigonometric functions.) The camera should not jump at all when the user starts or stops the animation and should preserve its current state.\nPart II\nFinal Project Part II DemoLinks in starter file\nOverview:\nIn the second part of the final project, you will use a matrix stack to structure your scene through hierarchical transformations. You will also implement simple shadows, reflections, and refractions.\nPart 2-1: Hierarchical Transformations\nPart 2-2: Hierarchical Camera\nPart 2-3: Shadows\nPart 2-4: Skybox\nPart 2-5: Reflections and Refractions (i.e. Environment Maps)\nMake bids and I will share more details and files also in chats.\nHappy Bidding!!!<b>Skills</b>:        TypeScript,                     JavaScript            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Javascript-Graphics-and-Animation_%7E01b64129f11e5f2e9a?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:02:47.240Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 20, 2024 18:16 UTC","id":"01b64129f11e5f2e9a"},{"skillset":["JavaScript","JetBrains WebStorm"],"title":"Javascript Graphics and Animation - Upwork","description":"Part I\nOverview:\nIn the first part of the final project, you will set up a complex scene by loading from two simple file formats&mdash;OBJ models accompanied by MTL material files.

Once everything is set up correctly, you should then turn your attention to the MTL files.\nDiffuse colors in the form &ldquo;Kd [R] [G] [B]&rdquo;\nSpecular colors in the form &ldquo;Ks [R] [G] [B]&rdquo;\nA diffuse texture map in the form &ldquo;map_Kd [Map Image]&rdquo;\nPart 1-2: Lighting\nNext, you will place a point light at the top of your streetlamp to illuminate your scene. Your light should use Phong shading, and you should use the previously loaded diffuse and specular material colors from the MTL file. You may create your own ambient color.\nAllow the user to press the &lsquo;L&rsquo; key to toggle the light on/off, but make sure that ambient light is still applied to your scene even when the light is off.\nImplementation Notes:\nYour lighting will likely look flat simply due to the normals on the provided models not being smoothed.\nPart 1-3: Texturing\nNext, you will implement texturing in your program using the texture coordinates loaded from the stop sign&rsquo;s OBJ file, accompanied by the stop.png texture as specified in the map_Kd attribute of the material in stopsign.mtl.\nImplementation Notes:\nThe texture coordinates in the OBJ file are flipped along the Y-axis; to get your final texture coordinates, you should subtract the V coordinates from 1.\nPart 1-4: Camera Animation\nFinally, you will implement basic camera animation so that the user can view your scene from different angles. When the user presses the &lsquo;C&rsquo; key, make the camera move along a circle on the XZ plane, while bobbing up and down slightly (along the Y-axis) as shown in the demo. (HINT: Think about how you might use the trigonometric functions.) The camera should not jump at all when the user starts or stops the animation and should preserve its current state.\nPart II\nFinal Project Part II DemoLinks in starter file\nOverview:\nIn the second part of the final project, you will use a matrix stack to structure your scene through hierarchical transformations. You will also implement simple shadows, reflections, and refractions.\nPart 2-1: Hierarchical Transformations\nPart 2-2: Hierarchical Camera\nPart 2-3: Shadows\nPart 2-4: Skybox\nPart 2-5: Reflections and Refractions (i.e. Environment Maps)\nMake bids and I will share more details and files also in chats.\nHappy Bidding!!!<b>Skills</b>:        JavaScript,                     JetBrains WebStorm            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Javascript-Graphics-and-Animation_%7E01302e54f4e0ea44bd?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:02:47.240Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 20, 2024 07:13 UTC","id":"01302e54f4e0ea44bd"},{"skillset":["Automation","Bot","Instagram","Script","Desktop Application"],"title":"Social media bot - Upwork","description":"In short:\nI am currently using multiple separate applications to automate a number of things on social media platforms, primarily instagram.

To accurately represent this character, I&#039;m doing some research on what the true lived experience for this type of character could look and feel like.\nSpecifically, I&#039;m looking for insights on what it&#039;s like to grow up in a small town which tend to be predominantly white. Even more specifically, this small town is located in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. While there are three Mohawk reservations nearby (Akwesasne, Kahnawake, and Kanesatake), they&#039;re all quite far from the Eastern townships, which means that even a Mohawk character would be quite isolated from his community. The parents of this character have raised him in this town due to their jobs as zoologists, and since the biggest zoo in the province is in Granby, they had to live nearby. \nI&#039;m looking to:\n-Accurately describe the relationship between this man and his culture, as well as the dynamics he had to exist within away from his community\n-Get a fully fleshed-out character\n-Portray this character with respect and sensitivity\nWith this in mind, I&#039;m looking to speak to people of Canadian Indigenous communities - even better if you belong to a community located somewhere in the province of Quebec, such as the Cree or Mohawk people. \nThe role will entail conversations over text directly on the Upwork platform - no phone/video interviews necessary.\nI had a Mohawk character in mind. With that being said, I only want to write about a character if I can accurately and respectfully represent them. This means I am open to hearing from other cultures and changing the character. I am still VERY early in the outlining process and his personality/charachter arc has not been developed yet.\nIf you think your lived experience fits what I&#039;m looking for, please apply! \nTo apply, please share a bit of information about what perspective you can give me. At this time, I am only interested in speaking to people who belong to Indigenous communities of Canada directly, so please do not apply if you do not belong to these communities, even if you have a degree in Indigenous studies.

Set your price what you thing the job is worth.\nNow the job:\nHello, I have a web server that keeps getting infected by warms... its on Apache with php,mysql on Debian. No matter what I do viruses keep infecting neighboring sites (vhosts) and things at this point are beyond repair. So I&#039;ve been advised to go the docker way with a reverse proxy with WAF in front the website containers and it sounds promising. \nImportant:\nI do not want the job just done once but to know how to set it up myself in case everything goes south... \nIf I have to summarize - I need a step by step tutorial how to turn brand new Ubuntu server into this (as follows):\n1 Docker container - proxy (nginx) + waf like in this tutorial (https://medium.com/cloud-native-daily/dockerized-mod-security-waf-c3e7233be002) + Certbot or other auto ssl solution with cronjob.\n3 more containers as follows \n1 wordpress (latest)\n1 joomla (latest)\n1 drupal (latest)\n- Static IP&#039;s on the containers\n- Php on each container to be at least 8.0\n- Bash on every container\n- SSH with unique port on the host machine forwarding to each container, \n- Phpmyadmin on every container, \n- Files from each container&#039;s www directory have to be mapped to a host machine folder in order to be preserved in the case of rebuilding the container. - here I have a little dejavu with the cross-contamination of my current setup, so if not a good idea to pup files from different sites close to eachother, then we can skip this setup and I&#039;ll think of a regular file backup \n- This would be nice as well: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html\nIf you have any suggestions to better the idea explained in the beginning - please do so.\nI may have asked stupid stuff above as I am new to how Docker works and what can or can not be done... so please feel free to correct me so the job requirement becomes more clear. I just want to have a working set of web servers in separate container behind reverse proxy+WAF+ssl to avoid breaching or cross-contamination in the event of a breach.\nI hope all this makes sense.\nI really need to hear your thought on this first.

We need someone to build out the sidebars and connect them to a series of backend services.\nHere are two example workflows for how we intend these add-ons to function:\n1. Based on data in a Google Sheet, the add-on will populate pages of a Google Docs file based on a template and provide the link in the sheet and update the relevant task in ClickUp.\n2. Based on selected options in the add-on, it will copy the correct slides from the master template, create a new Slides file, and add it to the relevant task in ClickUp.\nIn one of the attached screenshots you&#039;ll see an example of how the Project Tracker is generated in Google Sheets and the data is populated from ClickUp.
