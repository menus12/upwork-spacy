Once you begin the survey, you have up to 72 hours to complete it, beyond which time the survey platform will mark your responses as incomplete. Please pay attention to all the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSince many established resources for employees such as organizational support or supervisors do not apply to freelancers, this study intends to help freelancers with strategies to have a better freelancing experience on Upwork or other comparable platforms. We will use your answers to guide new and experienced freelancers on building their profiles on labor platforms like Upwork and managing their freelancing career, as well as suggest improvements to the platforms and to policymakers. If you are interested, we can provide you with a brief summary of our major findings from our completed research study once our research is complete (tentatively August 2025 or earlier), after contacting you via Upwork.\nWe welcome freelancers across experience levels, earnings, and ratings who:\n(i) provide freelancing services on their own (not as part of an agency or company),\n(ii) are over 18 years of age,\n(iii) have provided freelancing services for more than 1 year on Upwork,\n(iv) have worked on freelancing projects in the past 1 year on Upwork (consider July 2022-June 2023 as the past 1 year), and\n(iv) have a Job Success Score on their profile.\nIf you meet all the criteria listed above, please respond to this online survey job posting only if you consent to participating in this survey and allowing us to use certain details from your public Upwork profile for statistical purposes.\nProcedure: In this survey you will not have any more risks than you have in normal life. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board.\nYou will not be personally identified in our analysis or reporting. While storing the data from the survey, a participant ID number will be used instead of your name. However, we will collect some information from your public Upwork profile with your consent (e.g., ratings, job category, total earnings, number of jobs, number of successfully completed jobs and jobs in progress, hourly rate, pricing strategy (fixed vs. hourly), profile title and keywords, number of reviews, type of recognition badge, number of years of educational and work experience, number of skill tags, country, gender, job success score, availability of&nbsp;&nbsp;portfolio, testimonials, certifications, availability badge, and profile video) to understand the difference in freelance experience. Profile information that is captured from your public profile on Upwork with your consent, will be depersonalized for data analysis and reporting so that it is not identifiable with your details and will only be recorded against your participant ID number. These details and your responses will be kept confidential and used for academic purposes only. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board. Data will be stored in a secure academic database on university-licensed cloud storage to ensure confidentiality.\nPlease use a laptop or tablet to complete the survey. We recommend not using mobile.\nCompensation: You will receive $8 for your participation. Kindly note, you will be compensated upon completion of the entire interview as per standard Upwork processes. At the end of the survey, you will be provided with a random ID number (numerical code) that will need to be shared with us on Upwork Message. This will enable us to process your compensation via the Upwork platform, as per standard Upwork processes.\nYou can stop participating in the survey at any time. You may skip the questions, where applicable or use the &lsquo;Not applicable or NA&rsquo;/&lsquo;Not sure&rsquo;/&lsquo;Prefer not to disclose&rsquo; options, or even close the browser to end the survey. While we hope that you will complete the survey, we will compensate you for the first milestone for partial completion of the survey.

Zoning and Development Guidelines: The property is zoned as Rural Residential with a requirement for onsite effluent disposal due to the lack of reticulated sewer. The Structure Plan for the area needs to be in compliance with the local planning scheme and the outlined density requirements.\n2. Bushfire Management: Given the bushfire prone nature of the area, a detailed Bushfire Management Plan must be prepared to address bushfire risk, including Asset Protection Zones, access routes, and firefighting measures.\n3. Effluent Disposal Capability: The site has been assessed for onsite effluent disposal capability, and the plan should incorporate provisions for individual ATUs and absorption beds for effluent treatment.\n4. Water Supply: The property does not have access to mains potable water supply, so each dwelling must be equipped with water tanks for rainwater harvesting. The design should include adequate roof catchment area and tank capacity.\n5. Site Conditions: Consider the topography, soil types, and groundwater levels on the site to inform the design of the dwellings and infrastructure.\n6. Heritage and Environmental Considerations: Ensure that no heritage sites are impacted, and any environmental assets are protected or appropriately integrated into the design.\n7. Servicing and Utilities: Plan for extension of power and telecommunication services to the dwellings, as well as the provision of access roads and emergency services access routes.\n8. Design Guidelines: Develop design guidelines for the proposed dwellings, including considerations for solar orientation, water-sensitive urban design, and sustainable building practices.\nBy incorporating these key considerations into the design plan, you can create a comprehensive and compliant proposal for the development of the property at 25 Rowe Street.\nConsideration of Surrounding Environment: As the property is located in Margaret River, known for its natural beauty, it is important to design the project in a way that enhances the surrounding area and fits harmoniously within the environment.\nIn preparing the brief for the property at 25 Rowe Rd W with 6 ancillary dwellings, it is essential to address these key points and ensure that the design proposal aligns with the regulations and guidelines of the Margaret River council. The goal is to create a unique and inviting space that not only meets the needs of guests but also respects and enhances the beauty of the area.

I would like the units to be private and secluded from each other, with bamboo hedges providing natural barriers. My goal is to create a villa-style, private serviced apartment stay for holiday guests.\nI understand that obtaining development approval for this project may be challenging, so I would like to carefully consider the guidelines set forth by the Margaret River council to ensure that the application is appropriate and successful.

Scope of the project.\nYou will be adding new functionality to an existing product called Big6 plug-in for home automation software HomeSeer.com. Description of Big6 is available here\nhttp://big6.ivanv.com\nAs you can see Big6 supports 6 protocols. The task at hand is to add another protocol called Matter.\nMatter is a new protocol for home automation supported by Google, Amazon and many others. Here is a general description of the Matter protocol\nhttps://csa-iot.org/newsroom/peeking-under-the-hood-of-your-matter-smart-home/\nWell developed SDK and API do exist for easy programming. Look here for example\nhttps://developers.home.google.com/matter/overview\nYou will be doing for HomeSeer similar work to the work others did for Home Assistant. Take a look here\nhttps://github.com/home-assistant-libs/python-matter-server\nHomeSeer.com does have it&#039;s own SDK as well that you can see here\nhttps://github.com/HomeSeer/Plugin-SDK\nIf you are successful adding Matter to Big6 than we will consider hiring you long term to do maintenance of Big6.\n2. Get familiar with the environment (takes 15 min)\nDownload and install homeseer.com home automation software (free trial)\nGo to Plugins--Manage--Add and add Big6 plug-in\nActivate Big6 plug-in\nGo to Plugins--Big6--Profiles Cofiguration\nCreate new HTTP GET profile as follows\nName: Test\nURL: https://randomuser.me/$input\nThe word input must be in curly brackets not allowed here\nLog box: checked\nleave everything else blank at this profile page and save it\nIn HomeSeer go to &amp;quot;Events&amp;quot; tab\nCreate new event as follows\nName: Test1\nTrigger: Manualy triggered\nAction: Big6HTTP (select it from the drop down box)\nProfile: Test (the one that you just created)\nMessage box: blank\nInput box: api\nSave and run the event. Go to the log at Tools--Log and see the data that you received from executing the event\nGo to Devices and select Floor: Big6 and Room: HTTP See a new device named Test that Big6 has created.\nWith this simplified experiment you managed to send data out and to receive data in over HTTP using Big6. Furthermore Big6 created HomeSeer device automatically to hold the information received for further use.\nThe project at hand here is to send data out (control) and receive data in (status) to Matter enabled devices in compliance with Matter protocol. Since Matter enabled devices need to be adopted first within Big6&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;quot;fabric&amp;quot; than developing this functionality is also part of the job.\nAs far as Matter rides on top of TCP and UDP and as far as both TCP and UDP are supported by Big6 now, than no work is expected at lower levels than the application layer.\n3. Deliverables and testing\nNew tab in Big6 profiles &amp;quot;Matter&amp;quot; with similar functionality as the other profiles.\nThe new profile page will have everything necessary to setup a Matter profile.\nUnlimited number of Matter profiles will be allowed\nThe new profile page will have all the fileds nececessary to parse input and create HomeSeer devices (similar to the lower part of HTTP profile).\nIt will support all functionality such as expressions in the fields.\nNew item Big6Matter will show up in Event Actions drop down menu\nNew Big6Matter action will open additional fields as needed for the action\nNew ! Functionality to adopt Matter enabled device.\nYou will wrap your code per HomeSeer requirements for a new plug-in and produce .zip file\nI will upload the file and create new stand alone plug-in called &amp;quot;Matter&amp;quot; for testing purposes.\nI do have Matter enabled devices.\nYour product must be able to adopt the Matter devices and than control the devices and finally receive status information from devices and process it in a similar fashion as the other Big6 supported protocols (profiles).\nIf all of the above works satisfactory than I will give you access to Big6 code to incorporate your code into Big6.\nThe project will be considered completed after that, and payment due for the project.\n4. Maintenance. We request&nbsp;&nbsp;that you provide 6 months maintenance and bug fixing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be paid as part of the project costs.\n5.

It requires a multi-disciplinary approach, incorporating various technical skills and tools. When hiring someone to make an ATS software, you&#039;ve already identified several essential skills. However, to ensure a robust and scalable ATS, you may consider expanding the list of required skills and areas of expertise. Here is a more detailed list to help you find the right candidate or team:\n- Technical Skills and Knowledge\n1. Python for Backend Development: Including experience with web frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask) for rapid development and deployment.\n2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): For resume parsing, job matching, and enhancing search functionalities. Knowledge in libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or transformers is essential.\n3. Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis, crucial in handling the large volumes of data an ATS system will process.\n4. Frontend Development: Knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks/libraries like React.js, Angular, or Vue.js for building a user-friendly interface.\n5. Backend Development: Besides Python, familiarity with other backend technologies like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or PHP could be beneficial for certain integrations or specific use cases.\n6. Database Management: Proficiency in database technologies such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or SQL Server for data storage, retrieval, and management.\n7. API Integration: Experience with integrating third-party APIs (LinkedIn, job boards, social media, etc.) and building custom APIs for various services within the ATS.\n8. DevOps and CI/CD Pipelines: Knowledge in continuous integration and continuous deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to streamline development workflows.\n9. Cloud Services: Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for hosting, scalability, and storage solutions.\n10. Security and Compliance: Understanding of web security best practices (OWASP standards) and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) to ensure the ATS is secure and compliant.\n11. Containerization and Orchestration: Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, or similar technologies for containerization and efficient deployment.\n12. User Authentication and Authorization: Knowledge of implementing secure login systems and managing user permissions.\n13. Software Testing: Proficiency in automated testing frameworks for backend (pytest, unittest) and frontend (Jest, Selenium) to ensure reliability and performance.\nAdditional Considerations\n- UI/UX Design: While not a primary development skill, understanding the principles of user interface and user experience design is crucial for building an ATS that is both efficient and pleasant to use.\n- Project Management: Skills in project management methodologies (Agile, Scrum) could be beneficial for overseeing the development process and ensuring timely delivery.\n- Understanding of Recruitment Processes: Familiarity with HR processes and challenges can guide the development to be more aligned with end-user needs.\n- Scalability and Performance Optimization:&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability to design systems that can scale efficiently and perform under high load, considering future growth.\nWhen drafting the job description or the project brief, clearly outlining these skills and specifying any particular technologies or methodologies you prefer will help attract candidates who are well-suited for developing a comprehensive ATS system. Additionally, consider whether you need an individual freelancer with a broad skill set or a team of specialists who can cover different areas of the project.<b>Skills</b>:        Python Scikit-Learn,                     Spring Framework,                     API,                     MySQL,                     Python,                     Web Development,                     PHP,                     HTML,                     CSS,                     Java,                     Database Design            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/ATS-system-development_%7E010cec3aeeb0cfb51e?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T21:18:31.725Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 06, 2024 06:37 UTC","id":"010cec3aeeb0cfb51e"},{"skillset":["Mobile App Testing","Annotated Screenshot","Automated Testing","End-to-End Testing","Mobile App Development","CI/CD"],"title":"Setup CI/CD and automated testing for iOS and Android mobile apps built using Cordova/Capacitor - Upwork","description":"We want to Setup CI/CD and automated testing for iOS and Android mobile apps built using Cordova/Capacitor.\nWith automated on-device testing, screenshots comparison for verification, uploading builds for testing, app store submissions for final releases, etc...\nUsing Github Actions or other similar services.<b>Skills</b>:        Mobile App Testing,                     Annotated Screenshot,                     Automated Testing,                     End-to-End Testing,                     Mobile App Development,                     CI/CD            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Setup-and-automated-testing-for-iOS-and-Android-mobile-apps-built-using-Cordova-Capacitor_%7E01a9bdbc8a4a732c0b?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T21:18:31.725Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 05, 2024 12:37 UTC","id":"01a9bdbc8a4a732c0b"},{"skillset":["Application Release Automation","Deployment Automation","CI/CD","Automated Testing"],"title":"Setup CI/CD and automated testing for Angular app (front end web app only, no backend server) - Upwork","description":"Setup CI/CD and automated testing for Angular app (front end web app only, no backend server). \nUpload separate builds for each pull-request, and commit on main+demo branches.
