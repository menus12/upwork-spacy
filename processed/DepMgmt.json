It&#039;s essential that you are genuinely interested in the niche website&#039;s development beyond financial gains. The website&#039;s services revolve around utilizing the Spotify API and related aspects of the music industry, aiming to assist artists and playlist curators in expanding their audience and listenership on Spotify.\nThe initial task involves creating the HOME page, serving as the primary landing page, presenting comprehensive information about the service, its functionalities, and pricing details. The top navigation bar features the service logo on the left and a &amp;quot;Connect with Spotify&amp;quot; button on the right.\n1. Integration with Spotify API to connect user profiles.\n2. Once connected, the page dynamically showcases profile statistics in the central content area, activating the &amp;quot;Dashboard&amp;quot; section in the navigation bar. Additional navigation options include &amp;quot;Upgrade My Plan,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Track Trade In Playlist,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Grow My Playlist,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Listen and Earn Free Credits&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;My Campaigns,&amp;quot; along with a button indicating the available credit amount that after pressing button directs user to &amp;quot;Upgrade My Plan&amp;quot; page.\nAll website functions are contingent upon the credit balance. Users receive two free credits daily upon logging in.\n&amp;quot;Upgrade My Plan&amp;quot; directs users to a page displaying pricing options and their current plan status. Initially, users are on the Free plan with 50 credits available. The page also indicates the duration until the next payment for premium plans, highlighting the remaining days and additional credit balance. A small &amp;quot;Cancel Subscription&amp;quot; button is available for premium plans.\n&amp;quot;Track Trade In Playlist&amp;quot; is where you can trade tracks from your playlists. First, website check if your playlists are real using another website&#039;s tool (API). Then, we display your verified playlists and playlist followers. Once you pick a track, you have to select one of the genres fom dropdown list for your playlist. Then website start a trade campaign, showing your playlist and the song you want to swap to other users who also entered this campaign. You can easily browse through different playlist genres and follower counts to find suitable playlist track trade user. To submit your offer to other user, you need to use your own credits earned on website. The number of credits you will need to spend depends on the difference in followers and estimated streams between the playlists + additional credit goes to website holder that is the fee for contacting other profile for this offer. After you send credits to other user and website holder, webesite notifies the other user with details of your offer, prefered also through email. They can accept or reject it. If they accept, both songs are added to each other&#039;s playlists, and you get the credits offered. If they decline, you get your credits back, but not the credits spent for website service.\n&amp;quot;Boost My Playlist&amp;quot; lets you promote your playlist. Pick a playlist you want to share (similar to starting set up of &amp;quot;Track Trade In Playlist&amp;quot; where another website&#039;s tool (API) checks playlist and user have to select genre of playlist), and it will appear in the &amp;quot;Power Hour&amp;quot; section of other users&#039; profiles. &amp;quot;Power Hour&amp;quot; is a sub page where all acivity is happening - Users listen to your playlist, and for each song they listen to, they earn credits. The more they listen, the more credits they get. To join the &amp;quot;Power Hour,&amp;quot; users need to spend some credits, but they get them back after listening for an hour. The idea is simple: listen to others&#039; playlists, and they&#039;ll listen to yours, helping everyone grow their playlists together. User is not able to pick playlist he wants to listen - playlist appears on screen depending on demand from other user listening activity. Only thing that user can do is selecting genre of playlist he want to listen.\n&amp;quot;Track Campaign&amp;quot; functions similarly to &amp;quot;Grow My Playlist,&amp;quot; but users promote specific Spotify tracks by entering their links, which also incur a &amp;quot;Power Hour&amp;quot; entrance fee.\n&amp;quot;Listen and Earn Free Credits&amp;quot; displays submitted other website user tracks from &amp;quot;Grow My Playlist&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Track Campaign,&amp;quot; allowing users to earn credits by listening. Users can listen up to 10 tracks every 12 hours, each granting two additional free credits.\n&amp;quot;My Campaigns&amp;quot; provides an overview of ongoing activities, including notifications for track trade offers, progress in playlist growth campaigns, and track promotion campaigns.\nIf you&#039;re interested, feel free to get in touch with me.

Unlike a portfolio-focused site, this one should center around detailed, long-form content, acting as both a sales and landing page.\nDesign Philosophy:\n- Aim for simplicity and clarity.\n- The homepage will feature:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- A hero section with a prominent heading and subheading.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- A section showcasing our clients with a slider or images.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- A brief introduction outlining our unique approach and services.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- A concise list of services with brief descriptions.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- Multiple calls to action.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- Testimonials section.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- Sections highlighting benefits of our services.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- A showcase of 4-5 case studies.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- Accreditations.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- FAQs.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;- Integration of a Calendly form and a contact form.\nStyle Guidelines:\n- Focus is more on content rather than aesthetics.\n- Option for a dark theme with white text or a light theme with dark text.\n- Font choices should be classic and legible, avoiding overly futuristic styles.\nThe Concept: A website that exudes authority and professionalism, focusing on high-quality content to reflect our expertise in SEO. This is part of a broader strategy to eventually link this SEO agency with our Web Agency, though they will function as independent entities for now.\nSpecial Request: Please provide a genuine quote. I value transparency and consistency in pricing, especially given that the content is already prepared and the project requirements are straightforward.

The system waits for the label to be printed and then returns to the scanning step for the next order.\nIf you are interested please let me know your interest and don&#039;t use AI to apply.\nBelow give you a rough idea.\nhttps://api-docs.starshipit.com/\nBased on the Starshipit API documentation and support articles, here are the key steps to implement your desired workflow:\n1. When you fetch the unfulfilled orders from Shopify via the Starshipit API, store the order details including the order number in your local database.\n2. In your web interface, set up the barcode scanning functionality to look up orders by their order number. When an order is found, display its details on the page.\n3. Provide buttons or options on the page to select the packaging type and shipping service for that order. For example, have options for Regular vs Express post, and Small/Regular/Large/Extra Large satchel sizes.\n4. When one of those packaging/service buttons is clicked:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Capture the selected packaging type, size, and shipping service.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Make a POST request to the Starshipit `/labels` endpoint, passing in:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The order number and other required order details\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The selected packaging and shipping service details in the `shippingMethod` parameter\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Set `updateTracking` to `false` to prevent updating Shopify status\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Starshipit will generate the shipping label and return it in the API response.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Display or download the label for printing.\n5. After successfully generating the label, update the order status to &amp;quot;printed&amp;quot; in your local database. Do not update Shopify yet.\n6. Later, when you are ready to mark the orders as fulfilled in Shopify:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Display the list of &amp;quot;printed&amp;quot; orders in your web interface. \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Provide a button to trigger the tracking update for selected orders.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. When clicked, make a POST request to the Starshipit `/tracking` endpoint:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pass in the order number and tracking details\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Set `updateTracking` to `true`\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Starshipit will send the tracking info to Shopify and mark the order as fulfilled.\nThe key points are:\n- Use the `/labels` endpoint to generate labels, specifying the packaging and shipping service in the `shippingMethod` parameter. Set `updateTracking` false.\n- Use the `/tracking` endpoint as a separate later step to update tracking in Shopify. Set `updateTracking` true.\n- Store order and tracking status locally in your own database to decouple label printing from Shopify fulfillment.\nSo in summary, the Starshipit API provides the necessary endpoints to implement your desired workflow. You can control the label generation and Shopify tracking update as separate steps by leveraging the `updateTracking` flag and managing order state in your local database.<b>Skills</b>:        Ruby on Rails,                     Web Development,                     API            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Starshippit-Intergration-with-Ruby-Rails_%7E013b26f141068d45d3?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T20:19:05.941Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 18, 2024 06:25 UTC","id":"013b26f141068d45d3"},{"skillset":["Social Media Marketing","Content Writing","Virtual Assistance","Social Media Content Creation","Administrative Support","Communications","Social Media Content","Social Media Management"],"title":"Virtual / Social Media Assistant - Upwork","description":"\nWe are seeking a creative, organized, and proactive Social Media / Virtual Assistant to support our marketing team.
