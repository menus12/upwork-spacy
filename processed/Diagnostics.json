Their main persona/avatars are system administrators (the user) and normally CIO/CISOs approve the subscription (the decisions makers).\nSaaS product description:\n&amp;quot;X was designed to bring your existing enterprise IT data together in a meaningful way. X aligns all of those different data sets, paving the way for you to have meaningful insight to what is really running on your network and how it&rsquo;s allowed to communicate.

How much of that industry does the U.S. Department of Defense and/or federal government make up?

X% working for DOD. etc.&amp;quot; \n-------This way when analyzing cybersecurity communities on social platforms such as LinkedIn, Youtube, etc. we can make an educated guess what percentage of the total community works for the U.S. government.\n- How many DOD agencies and departments? How many system admins within those departments?\n- What are the organizational structures of the cybersecurity departments within these agencies?\n- How many agencies have to do their own GRC? \nPart 2----\nWhere do these cybersecurity professionals hang out online? What communities, forums, social platforms groups, etc.? Are there any specific to government cybersecurity professionals?\nPart 3----\n- investigate whether other large organizations could use this type of software, such as:\n1. Large hospitals \n2.

Specifically,\nInitial Situation\nGlobastar AG is a Business VoIP and Internet provider (B2B) licensed as an independent telecommunications service provider by the Federal Office of Communications (BAKOM). Our customers include SMEs, retailers, and call centers in Turkey, Kosovo, Ukraine, and Morocco. We operate our own CloudPBX solution as well as MS Teams connections for end customers and third-party providers. The SIP infrastructure of Globastar AG, which runs telecommunications servers in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), is heavily used by the mentioned customer groups for telephony. Occasionally, we receive requests from the Federal Department of Justice and Police (EJPD) for the monitoring of selected or received calls, where we must electronically provide the A and B numbers and contract holders of the connections to the authorities (Lawful Interception of Telecommunication Traffic). In some cases, call recordings must also be provided. So far, we have obtained the data from our upstream provider (Colt/Sunrise/Awantel). Now, these data should be consolidated daily from our telecom switches (Inbound/Outbound/Kazoo) into a database on a dedicated computer to quickly analyze them in case of requests. As the data must be legally archived for 6 months, the created database must be stored on the local NAS. The partner company future comm AG, which also operates on our platform, should be able to make queries on this system via VPN (access).\nDetailed Task Description\nIn principle, all Call Detail Records (CDR) from the three relevant servers must be loaded onto the dedicated computer every 24 hours using SCP (automated script). The success or failure of this function should be emailed to email. Call Detail Records from the servers FS1 Outbound, FS2 Inbound should be fetched using secure SSH with a script to be built. The script should also determine whether it contains records or not; in case of empty content, an alert message should be sent to email.\nFor Kazoo, connections accumulated in the respective period must be retrieved via API and also saved in a CSV file on the dedicated computer. All points of Lawful Interception of Telecommunication Traffic must be covered. Using Postman, Call Detail Records should be queried every 24 hours, written to a suitable .csv file.\nThe CDRs obtained via SCP from servers FS1, FS2, and the created CSV (from the API) should be stored in a Postgres database in a table (cdrarchiv) using a script. No duplicates should be allowed (only the latest records can be read in via the UUID - Primary Key). Records older than 6 months should be exported as an archive (1x monthly ZIP file MMYY.ZIP), deleted from the database, and transferred to the internal NAS via FTP.\nAn informative logfile should be created for easy and quick problem identification in case of an error. Date/Time, Function, Normal Execution, Error. The logfile should be stored on the dedicated computer and deleted after a week.\nPgAdmin should be installed and configured to filter connections, timeframes, and contract holders for delivering a report to the EJPD. Two users should be set up, one for Globastar and one for future comm. The table cdrarchiv will be installed through the first import.\nThe data in the Postgres database should be backed up daily to the local NAS in compressed form (ZIP) (Backup).\nA technical documentation should be created, including a network diagram, a user manual for the users, and documentation of the interfaces.\nA VPN should be created for our partner company future comm AG, allowing them to retrieve evaluations. We will use the Tailscale VPN application, creating a subaccount under our main account for futurecomm, providing them access only to our dedicated computer.\nA test concept is to be developed, including the initial situation, framework conditions, test cases for all aspects of the task description, and the expected results.<b>Skills</b>:        Google Cloud Platform,                     Linux,                     MySQL,                     Cloud Testing,                     Business with 1-9 Employees,                     Writing,                     PostgreSQL,                     MariaDB,                     MySQL Programming,                     Ubuntu,                     Microsoft Word            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/School-projects_%7E012982a808a3964509?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:42:00.975Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 29, 2024 07:45 UTC","id":"012982a808a3964509"},{"skillset":["Python","Selenium","Automation","Automated Testing","Test Automation Framework"],"title":"Software Developer for Automation Software Project (Selenium and Python experience critical) - Upwork","description":"We in need of an experienced Software Developer to create an automation software similar to Dripify and SaleRobot.

This would require obviously Wireshark experience and knowledge in architecture of Windows applications.\nSoftware Engineering with a focus on Reverse Engineering: We need a specialist that has a strong background in software engineering, especially in reverse engineering of software applications. This involves understanding how the application is built and operates without having access to the source code. Skills in decompiling, analyzing binary code, and understanding the functionality of the application are crucial.\nNetwork Engineering and Analysis: Proficiency in network engineering is important, with a specific emphasis on network traffic analysis. You should have extensive experience with tools like Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic to understand how the application communicates over the network.\nKnowledge of REST APIs: Since the task involves reverse-engineering network connections that presumably use a REST API, the specialist should be familiar with how REST APIs are structured and operate. This includes understanding HTTP methods, status codes, request and response formats, and API authentication mechanisms.\nCybersecurity Skills: The nature of this work also touches on cybersecurity, particularly in the realms of ethical hacking and penetration testing. You should understand how to ethically probe and analyze applications to uncover vulnerabilities or understand their network interactions without causing harm or violating laws or ethics.\nWindows Application Architecture: A deep understanding of Windows application architecture is necessary. This includes familiarity with the Windows API, system calls, and how applications interact with the Windows operating system at a low level.\nProgramming and Scripting Skills: The ability to write scripts or programs to automate the analysis process, manipulate network packets, or mimic application behavior can be incredibly valuable.
