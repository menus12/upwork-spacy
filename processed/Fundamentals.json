Those errors/warnings were never before. We need to find out why these errors started to appear. \nThere are two important moments to this issue:\n- these errors/warnings appear ONLY AT RUNTIME (in actual WebGL builds), and don&#039;t appear in Editor at all\n- these errors/warnings appear only when our project loads content scenes from asset bundles (this is our main way of working with content scenes since they all are quite heavy and we have almost a hundred of them). If, just for the purposes of testing, a WebGL build is created with content scenes included directly into the build (no scene bundles used), then no errors/warnings appear\n- At the same time, the issue is not related to the data in scene bundles. We can load any scene bundle and errors/warnings will be the same. Even if we leave just a single scene bundle with a basically empty scene (only camera and simple cube), the errors/warnings will still appear\nThe example of the build can be taken here:\nhttps://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ivala.3dtesting/develop/upgrade-to-2022/issues/a0/index.html\nAttached is the example of errors/warnings.\nIf you think you can resolve these, please get in touch with&nbsp;&nbsp;an estimate of how long it would take.

My goal is to develop a script that uses PyGithub, that enables the creation of a repository under my account. I&#039;m currently trying to do so through a Jupyter notebook. I&#039;ve granted pretty much every permission under the sun to the GitHub app for this to work (as far as I know).\nHeres some stackoverflow pages that have gotten me close, but still with no success (see these for reference):\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/46524697/login-problems-using-pygithub\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/28675121/how-to-create-a-new-repository-with-pygithub\n**How to do it?**\nTo do this, you&#039;ll need to create a .ipynb file that does the job.

The service encompasses reading from, writing to, monitoring updates on files, and a client-side caching mechanism to optimize read operations. The service&#039;s design adheres to strict requirements for message marshalling/unmarshalling, fault tolerance, and supports two different invocation semantics: at-least-once and at-most-once.\n### Service Functionalities:\n1. **Read Operation**: Users can read a specific number of bytes from a file at a given offset. If the requested file or offset is invalid, an error is returned.\n2. **Write Operation**: Users can write a sequence of bytes to a specified offset in a file. If the file doesn&#039;t exist or the offset is invalid, an error is returned.\n3. **File Update Monitoring**: Users can register to monitor a file for updates over a specified interval. During this time, any updates are sent to the registered clients. Multiple clients can monitor a file simultaneously.\n4. **Client-side Caching**: Files read by the client are cached locally to expedite future read operations. Updates are immediately sent to the server to ensure cache consistency, implementing the approximate one-copy update semantics.\n### Requirements and Implementation Strategies:\n- The system comprises a server and multiple clients, communicating through UDP sockets. The server manages files stored locally, performing requested operations and replying to clients. The clients interface with users through a simple text-based console, sending requests to the server and displaying responses.\n- **Message Marshalling/Unmarshalling**: All messages, including file paths, content, and commands, are transmitted as byte arrays. This requires converting integers, strings, and other data types into a sequence of bytes before transmission and reversing this process upon receipt.\n- **Fault Tolerance**: The design includes measures for handling lost messages and ensuring reliable communication despite the unreliability of UDP. Techniques such as timeouts, request identifiers for detecting duplicates, and maintaining request histories are employed.\n- **Invocation Semantics**: The system supports both at-least-once and at-most-once invocation semantics. This involves managing timeouts and filtering duplicate messages. The semantics choice affects fault tolerance and consistency, particularly in handling non-idempotent operations.\n- **Client-side Caching**: Cached content metadata includes the file path and the last validation time. This cache helps in reducing network calls for read operations but requires synchronization with server updates to maintain consistency.\n- **Simulation of Message Loss**: The program simulates the loss of messages to test the effectiveness of the two invocation semantics. Experiments demonstrate that at-least-once semantics may lead to incorrect results for non-idempotent operations, whereas at-most-once semantics provide correct outcomes for all operations.\n### Development Considerations:\n- The server and client programs must be capable of concurrent operation, with the server handling requests in a sequential manner due to the assumption of well-separated client requests.\n- The system avoids the use of Java&#039;s built-in serialization and I/O stream classes, requiring manual implementation of data transmission mechanisms.\n- Detailed logging of requests and responses is essential for monitoring system operation and debugging.\n- The project demands well-commented source code for clarity and maintainability.\nThis summary encapsulates the project&#039;s goals, functional requirements, and technical strategies within the constraints of using low-level programming constructs for network communication and data handling. The focus is on reliability, consistency, and fault tolerance in a distributed file management context.<b>Skills</b>:        Java            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Distributed-System-Design-and-Implementation-System-for-Remote-File-Access_%7E013ccb835c852250b8?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:43:16.145Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 19, 2024 06:32 UTC","id":"013ccb835c852250b8"},{"skillset":["Linux","Node.js","DevOps","Kubernetes","Amazon Web Services","Docker"],"title":"Kubernetes + NodeJS Application for Efficient Autoscaling of VMs - Upwork","description":"We&#039;ve created a system which scales our application with Kubernetes, but we&#039;re running into an issue where the load times of spawning these VMs is very long.

Data- New has some data that is different from the old. These are settings and simple values that must be migrated over.

There are two components. One is a chrome extension and the other is a web app. This is a web app that takes a csv and does 3 things, cleans the csv, extracts data from it and uses an API to a PDF generator that returns this PDF as a media. I am a ML engineer so I did all of the data science part, I have the functions that clean the csv, extract data from it and the code that does a POST request to the API builder. I also have the code and built the chrome extension that finds the CSV. The way I want it to work is that users will use the chrome extension when they are on the page of the CSV (This is a real estate website) and then a pages open of our web app, (if they are logged in) then we show them a &ldquo;mapper&rdquo; which is the a UI that maps their columns to our columns but this part I will build the algorithm for it, for now it is &ldquo;kind of&rdquo; hard coded. Then once this is Confirmed then we show them the clean CSV with our columns headers names and their columns data, we technically drop the uncleaned csv but you don&rsquo;t have to worry about this because I built the code that does this so for you, you send a csv with mapping dictionary and you receive the cleaned csv and you have to display it, then they click on continue and it shows them COMP Data, this data has comes in form of a dictionary that also you don&rsquo;t have to worry about because I built this as well. Then we use Anvil, we send a POST request and we get a media response &ldquo;PDF&rdquo; that we show. Now all of this data, the cleaned CSV, the COMP Data, the PDFs and other metadata such as, data and other, these form a Comparable Analysis in our backend. What you build is the front end of the web app, the front end of the chrome extension (the current front end is just a button).
