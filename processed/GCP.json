They must be able to keep a voice conversation with each other.\n- Average framerate must be above 30 fps, and lag must never or very rarely occur.\n- App crashes should never occur in the finished app.\nVR environment\nThe VR environment will consist of&nbsp;&nbsp;5 parts that we will supply to the developer:\n- A mesh file in .ifc or .obj format that will represent a room in a building. In two smaller areas of the room, the mesh will be removed (void space).\n- For those two smaller areas, we will supply additional mesh files that fits.\n- For those two smaller areas, we will also supply point cloud files (.e57) that fits.\n- If necessary for performance, all surfaces can have a solid color (as opposed to being textured).\nVR content and functionality\n- In addition to the files mentioned above, we will also deliver around 10 smaller 3d-models in ifc format. The physical size of each of these will be less than 1x1x1 meters. These models must be placed on a blackboard or shelf in the VR-space.\n- The users must be able to pick up any of the smaller models and place them anywhere in the room. The models should not have gravity. E.g. if a model is placed in free air 1 meter above ground, it should stay there and not fall down.\n- When a user grabs one of the smaller models from the shelf, a new one should spawn within seconds.\n- All controls and inputs inside the app should be available from the hand controllers.\n- On the user&#039;s left hand there should be a popup menu with a few tools and settings:\n- 1. Toggle visibility on/off for all meshes, models and point clouds\n- 2. Measure distance in centimeters or millimeters between 2 points selected by a user\n- 3. Toggling between 2 modes of movement: &amp;quot;Flying&amp;quot; in the direction where the user points his right hand, and walking 1,8 meters above the VR-floor. The users should be able to fly through everything (no collision on them).\n- 4. Freehand drawing in 3d.\n- 5. Collectively exporting the models that have been placed out from the shelf as a single .ifc file.\n- All interactions in the VR environment must be visible for all users (e.g. if a user draws something, the other users should also see his drawing. If a user moves a model, the other users should see the movement).\nBonus functionality\nA bonus will also be paid if the following functionality is implemented:\n- Toggle on/off that the models from the shelf will rotate and snap to the closest 2 perpendicular axes when the user places them.\n- Toggle on/off that if a model from the shelf is placed close to another model, and their surfaces matches each other, the newest model will snap to the one already placed\n- Dynamic import of meshes, point clouds and 3d-models from a file picker in the app. The location to pick files from should be a cloud service like e.g. Google Disk, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox.\nTimeline\nTime is important to us. Estimated development time will be an important factor when selecting our development partner.\nThe last payment will be paid only when the following is achieved:\n- All requirements in this description has been fullfilled\n- The app and its complete source code has been delivered to us\nDeveloper requirements:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Proven experience in VR app development\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Familiarity with the Meta Quest 3 platform\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Strong knowledge of virtual reality technology and best practices\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Proficient in relevant programming languages (e.g., C#, Unity)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Attention to detail and ability to deliver high-quality work on time\nIf you have the expertise and passion for creating cutting-edge VR experiences, we would love to hear from you.

So you can change from FPV view to 3rd person view. The Camera Can Zoom in to simulate different lens sizes and would like to be able to zoom from a hypothetical 16mm to 500mm. (So super wide and can see everything to super tight). (refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xsm6yUYbIo )\nIn each level you can place the camera and assign it a position that it will travel to. So you can setup the camera in the first position (Save it) and then move to the second position (Save it) and then third, fourth and fifth position. You should be able to control the time it takes for the camera to move to each position and how long it stays at each position.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe Levels: \n- A City Level (Only needs to be 1-2 streets long) \n- Film Studio/Warehouse \n- Hollywood Backlot (Cowboy Western Style Set)\n(Option to add on more levels and future work if we get this right). \nThen I want half a dozen characters and a range of props/items you can place around and have move like this (This should skip to the exact part that shows the mechanics we want to manipulate the characters): https://youtu.be/0xsm6yUYbIo?si=Ah99fAY2L3xKvEcg&amp;amp;t=400\nLet me know your thoughts and happy to chat about anything further. <b>Skills</b>:        Unreal Engine,                     Game Design,                     Game Development,                     Unity,                     C#            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Develop-Game-UE5_%7E01631334bf9d655c37?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:04:26.735Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 09, 2024 22:07 UTC","id":"01631334bf9d655c37"},{"skillset":["Android","iOS","Mobile App Development","Game Development","Unreal Engine","In-App Purchases","Game Design"],"title":"Need an unreal engine developer for mobile app - Upwork","description":"Will need someone new to take over my unreal engine project.

This is what I was told was needed: \nCreating a GPT capable of directly editing and formatting Excel files involves integrating the GPT with software or services that can manipulate Excel files programmatically, such as through an API or a scripting language like Python with libraries such as OpenPyXL or Pandas for Excel file manipulation. The capability you mentioned, as seen in the GPT created by &amp;quot;pulsr.co.uk&amp;quot;, likely involves a backend system where the GPT serves as an interface to receive user requests, which are then processed by a backend service that performs the direct manipulation of Excel files.\nTo create a GPT with similar capabilities, you would need to:\nDevelop a Backend System: This system would handle file operations, including reading, writing, and modifying Excel files. It would use programming libraries that support Excel file manipulation.\nIntegrate GPT with the Backend: The GPT would need to be integrated with this backend system, so it can interpret user requests and translate them into specific file operations. This might involve custom API endpoints that the GPT can call with parameters based on user input.\nEnsure Security and Privacy: When dealing with files that users upload, particularly sensitive data like contact information, it&#039;s crucial to implement robust security and privacy measures to protect user data.\nUser Interface: For a seamless experience, you would also need to develop a user interface that allows users to upload files, input requests, and download the modified files. This UI would connect to the GPT and your backend system.\nWhile I can guide you on the concepts and steps required to create such a system, the actual development work involves programming and system architecture design that goes beyond what I can do for you directly. You might consider hiring a software developer or a team with experience in AI integration, web development, and data processing to build this system.\nIf you&#039;re looking to learn how to do this yourself, starting with Python programming and familiarizing yourself with libraries for Excel manipulation and web development (for API creation) would be a good foundation.

Here are some steps you can take:\n1. **Define Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**: Determine what sets ChromaChat apart from existing messaging apps. Is it a specific feature, a unique design approach, or a combination of both? Clarify your USP to guide your design and development efforts.\n2. **User Research**: Conduct thorough user research to understand the needs, preferences, and pain points of your target audience. Identify what they like and dislike about existing messaging apps to inform your design decisions.\n3. **Feature Prioritization**: Decide which features from WhatsApp, Telegram, and Snapchat you want to incorporate into ChromaChat. Prioritize the most essential ones and consider how they can be seamlessly integrated into the app&#039;s design.\n4. **Design Exploration**: Experiment with different design concepts and visual styles to find the best fit for ChromaChat. Consider factors such as color schemes, typography, iconography, and overall layout. Aim for a design that is both visually appealing and intuitive to use.\n5. **User Interface (UI) Design**: Create a clean and user-friendly interface that prioritizes ease of navigation and accessibility. Pay attention to details such as button placement, menu organization, and interaction feedback.\n6. **Interaction Design**: Design smooth and intuitive interactions that make it easy for users to perform common tasks such as sending messages, sharing media, and managing contacts. Incorporate gestures and animations where appropriate to enhance the user experience.\n7. **Privacy and Security**: Given the sensitive nature of messaging apps, prioritize privacy and security in your design. Implement robust encryption, authentication, and permission controls to protect users&#039; data and communication.\n8. **Testing and Iteration**: Conduct usability testing with real users to gather feedback on the app&#039;s design and functionality. Use this feedback to iterate and refine the design, addressing any usability issues or pain points that arise.\n9. **Accessibility**: Ensure that ChromaChat is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility best practices in design and development. This includes providing alternative text for images, keyboard navigation support, and compatibility with screen readers.\n10. **Launch and Marketing**: Once the app is ready, plan a strategic launch and marketing campaign to attract users and generate buzz. Highlight ChromaChat&#039;s unique features and design elements to differentiate it from competing messaging apps.\nBy following these steps and incorporating the best design practices from WhatsApp, Telegram, and Snapchat, you can create ChromaChat&mdash;an innovative messaging app that offers a seamless user experience and stands out in the crowded messaging market.<b>Skills</b>:        RxSwift,                     Firebase Cloud Firestore,                     iOS,                     Apple Xcode,                     iPadOS,                     watchOS,                     iOS Development,                     In-App Purchases,                     Flutter,                     iAd,                     WatchKit,                     iOS SDK,                     iPad App Development,                     Objective-C,                     Swift,                     Firebase            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Chatting-app_%7E014d23553b202670c5?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:05:35.325Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 05, 2024 20:25 UTC","id":"014d23553b202670c5"},{"skillset":["Appium","TestNG","Cucumber","Firebase Cloud Firestore","MySQL","Java","Apache Maven","JavaScript","Android","iOS"],"title":"Need A Mobile Automation Expert - Upwork","description":"I need a IOS and android mobile automation developer for testing.<b>Skills</b>:        Appium,                     TestNG,                     Cucumber,                     Firebase Cloud Firestore,                     MySQL,                     Java,                     Apache Maven,                     JavaScript,                     Android,                     iOS            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Need-Mobile-Automation-Expert_%7E0186b2b354f9858051?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:05:35.325Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 05, 2024 19:50 UTC","id":"0186b2b354f9858051"},{"skillset":["iOS Development","Firebase","Firebase Cloud Firestore","Firebase Realtime Database","Payment Functionality","Mobile App Development","Payment Gateway Integration","Dart","Audio Transcription","REST API","Version Control","Mobile App Design","Figma","Adobe XD","App Store Upload"],"title":"Flutter developer  - Upwork","description":"Hi Amir,\nI&#039;d like to personally invite you to apply to my job.\nPlease review the job post and apply if you&#039;re available,\nI have an app for uploading.\nBest regards Mohsin Zafar!<b>Skills</b>:        iOS Development,                     Firebase,                     Firebase Cloud Firestore,                     Firebase Realtime Database,                     Payment Functionality,                     Mobile App Development,                     Payment Gateway Integration,                     Dart,                     Audio Transcription,                     REST API,                     Version Control,                     Mobile App Design,                     Figma,                     Adobe XD,                     App Store Upload            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Flutter-developer_%7E013e900a66e0f679c8?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:05:35.325Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 05, 2024 13:00 UTC","id":"013e900a66e0f679c8"},{"skillset":["Tailwind CSS","Web Application","Vue.js","JavaScript","Firebase","Firebase Cloud Firestore"],"title":"Vue.js Developer with Capacitor Knowledge - Upwork","description":"We are seeking a talented Vue.js developer with expertise in Capacitor to join our team for an exciting project.

Project Overview\nThe EQUOTE aims to provide a seamless experience for users to request shipping quotes, view their quote history, and obtain tailored information based on their specific origin/destination location and commodities. The system will support manual and automatic calculation of shipping rates, insurance rates, and accessorial charges. If system can generate the rate, then user can receive the rate immediately. If it doesn&#039;t exist then admin have to be notified and manually calculate the costing.\n2. Functional Requirements\n2.1 User Account Management\nRegistration: Users/Admin can register by providing necessary information (e.g., name, email, password). Authentication is required\nLogin/Logout: Secure authentication system to access user-specific data.\nProfile Management: Users can update their profile information, and only the origin / destination locations they added. (user cannot add / edit locations created by admin (Admin should be able to control if user can edit locations/commodities)\n2.2 Quote Requests\nForm Submission: Users can submit requests for quotes through an interactive form, specifying details such as origin location, destination, commodity type, weight, and dimensions.\nQuote Calculation: The system calculates rates based on user input, and pre-defined logic for shipping, insurance, and accessorial charges. IF doesn&#039;t exist allows admin to manually calculate the rates.\nQuote History: Users can view their past quote requests and their statuses.\n2.3 Location and Commodity Information\nDynamic Content: Based on the user&rsquo;s assigned origin location, display relevant commodities and information.\nDatabase Updates: Admins can update location and commodity data as needed.\n3. System Architecture\n3.1 Frontend\nTechnologies: wordpress, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js).\nResponsive Design: Ensure the application is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.\nInteractive Forms: Design forms for user input with real-time validation.\nSearching: All grids needs to be able to sort/filter/search \n3.2 Backend\nFramework: Use a robust backend framework (current website on wordpress).\nAuthentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for secure authentication.\nAPI Development: RESTful APIs to handle requests between the frontend and backend.\n3.3 Database Design\nRDBMS: Use a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL or other ) to store user data, quote information, location, and commodity details.\nSchema Design:\nRefer to user/admin tabs in attach excel file\n4. Calculation Logic\nShipping Rates: create a table based on origin to destination Define rules and algorithms based on zipcode origin to zipcode destination, weight, and commodity type.\nInsurance Rates: Calculate based on commodity value and location additional insurance required rate\nAccessorial Charges: Additional charges based on specific requirements\n5. Security Considerations\nData Encryption: Use SSL/TLS for data transmission and encrypt sensitive information in the database.\nInput Validation: Implement server-side validation to prevent SQL injection and other malicious attacks.\nAccess Control: Ensure users can only access and modify their own information and quotes.\n6. Testing and Deployment\nUnit Testing: Write tests for individual components and functions.\nIntegration Testing: Ensure all parts of the system work together as expected.\nDeployment: Use www.ionos.ca cloud service provider for hosting the application.

Currently, no party has embraced the ideas I am presenting, and I lack the resources for it, relying on initiatives from like-minded colleagues. Consequently, I&#039;ve taken the initiative to launch it through a personal website, with no current funding in place.\nOur goal is to utilize the project&#039;s outputs for presentations aimed at attracting development projects and securing the involvement of official bodies, investors, and various beneficiaries.

There are about 100K/week truckloads that need to be optimized among about 60 Tier 1 and 200 Tier II warehouses in the U.S. I managed to use the classic column generation approach to solve this problem, i.e. the objective is to minimize total costs given the different constraints, such as how long a driver can work each day, and what is the hourly pay to the drivers, and etc. There are other company specific constraints as well.\nSince the dataset is very large, there are many deficiencies of running column generation for such a big data every week. I am looking for some optimization expert who also knows machine learning to come up with a tailor-made approach to manage big data optimization problem, i.e., optimization + machine learning. \nThe deliverable of this project is to convert this whole process into a high-quality academic research writing. I can provide my current brief writing, but my current writing is just a write-up of the basics to solve the business case, not suitable for serious academic purposes. \nSome basic requirements:\n1.\tAble to write high quality academic paper. \nAttached sample is the expected quality of writing. \n2.\tHave published optimization related work, or have been trained as a PhD in this field, or currently pursuing a PhD in related field. \n3.\tKnow machine learning and big data analytics.\n4.\tAble to simulate the optimization algorithm using synthetic data (just a portion of the weekly data if you don&rsquo;t have access to cloud computing power) and compare cost savings between your tailored algorithm and the classic column generation approach.\n5.\tAble to provide code in Python. \nI will provide a sample weekly data and the related cost and other assumptions needed for the optimization to run. I can share more details during our project kickoff meeting.\nProject Stages:\n1.\tStage 1 (8 weeks): Start to finish within 8 weeks.

Make sure they are in a compatible format (such as .mp4, .mov, or .flv).\nStore these video files in a location accessible by your Unreal Engine project.\nUnreal Engine Setup:\nCreate a new Unreal Engine project or use an existing one.\nIn the Content Browser, create a new folder called &ldquo;Media&rdquo; inside the Content folder.\nRight-click inside the empty Media folder, select &ldquo;Stream Media Source,&rdquo; and name the asset (e.g., &ldquo;MediaStream&rdquo;).\nOpen the MediaStream asset and enter the desired stream URL (direct link to your video file).\nCreate a Media Player asset (e.g., &ldquo;MyPlayer&rdquo;) and enable video output with a linked Media Texture asset.\nAssociate the Media Texture asset with the Media Player.\nVoice Input Integration:\nImplement voice recognition using a library or service (such as Google Speech-to-Text or Microsoft Azure Speech Service).\nCapture the user&rsquo;s voice input and convert it to text.\nAnswer Selection Logic:\nBased on the recognized question, determine which video file corresponds to the correct answer.\nYou can use a simple switch statement or more sophisticated logic to map questions to video files.\nStreaming the Video:\nUse Unreal Engine&rsquo;s media framework to play the selected video.\nApply the Media Texture to a UI element (e.g., a fullscreen widget) or even a Static Mesh (like a TV screen) in your level.\nStart streaming the video using the Media Player.\nServer Setup:\nIf you want to stream from an Unreal Engine server, consider using Unreal Engine&rsquo;s Pixel Streaming feature.\nPixel Streaming allows you to run your Unreal Engine application on a cloud server and stream rendered frames and audio to browsers and mobile devices over WebRTC 1.\nTesting and Deployment:\nTest your program locally to ensure voice recognition, video selection, and streaming work correctly.\nDeploy your Unreal Engine project to your desired server (local or cloud-based).<b>Skills</b>:        Unreal Engine,                     GitHub Copilot            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Unreal-Engine-Server_%7E01f161677b11339a2e?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:06:17.325Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 05, 2024 15:59 UTC","id":"01f161677b11339a2e"},{"skillset":["Google Cloud Platform"],"title":"Looking someone who knows Gmail API Pub/Sub - Upwork","description":"We are looking for expert in Gmail&#039;s Pub/Sub API to consult us as we build out an application that will run business logic on incoming and outgoing Gmail applications.\nHere&#039;s what we need \n1.

She is looking for an app to be built for iOS and Android in their native languages, Swift and Kotlin. She is possibly looking for the web version as well but still to be determined. She is getting a lot of aggressive competitive pricing from various software developers that have resumes so she is currently looking for someone that can get this done for under $1,000 USD. \nAzita is an expert marketer and knows how to get attention onto an app like this. Whomever is the selected developer will be listed on the associated website as the Lead Developer or Lead Engineer, which will foster you a lot of attention and future work as she markets the app out to the masses and speaks at different conferences and podcasts about it. There can also be future performance based compensation to be determined as the app garners success and generates money, so you potentially stand to make a lot more in the long run. \nThe startups/entrepreneurs who are sharing video style responses to typical interview questions one should expect from an investor, and the investors/VCs themselves who will look for startup projects to invest in. Video length could range from a few minutes up to half hour. The entrepreneur should be able to share what they post here across all of their other social media channels and should also have the ability to log in either via email and password or via one of their other social media platforms, Google single sign on, etc., but if they use a single sign on method, they still need to fill out their profile etc. There are other features that Azita can speak to more once a zoom call happens. \nThe developer should also know or have a team that knows how to efficiently deploy into production into AWS where the cloud is optimized for the lowest fees to AWS. Cloud deployment is part of the ask. We are open to exploring later on movement to Oracle Cloud or a blockchain based decentralized cloud computing solution. \nNative will be good as well though she is currently looking for someone to code directly in each of the native languages. To be fully transparent, she has received pricing as low as $500 USD, so this would likely be a project for someone that is overseas. \nThank you and we look forward to hearing back. <b>Skills</b>:        Kotlin,                     React,                     Web Development,                     Web Design,                     JavaScript,                     Front-End Development,                     Shopify Apps,                     Custom Web Design,                     Vue.js,                     Full-Stack Development,                     Flutter,                     React Native,                     Mobile App,                     Bug Fix,                     Mobile UI Design,                     Mobile App Development,                     Firebase,                     Swift            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/TikTok-Instagram-Bumble-Style-Video-Based-Mobile-App-Match-Investors-amp-Entrepreneurs_%7E014628f58e8263947a?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:06:17.325Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 05, 2024 04:06 UTC","id":"014628f58e8263947a"},{"skillset":["Microsoft Excel","CAD Conversion","Civil Engineering","Photogrammetry","Aerial Photography","Point Cloud to BIM","Land Surveying","Autodesk AutoCAD","AutoCAD Civil 3D","Google Earth","Data Visualization","Drone","GIS","SketchUp"],"title":"Structural design of gabion hydraulic weir - Upwork","description":"We require the structural design of a hydraulic weir for a river deviation project. \nWe have already done the hydraulic analysis and flood plain simulations.

Once you begin the survey, you have up to 72 hours to complete it, beyond which time the survey platform will mark your responses as incomplete. Please pay attention to all the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSince many established resources for employees such as organizational support or supervisors do not apply to freelancers, this study intends to help freelancers with strategies to have a better freelancing experience on Upwork or other comparable platforms. We will use your answers to guide new and experienced freelancers on building their profiles on labor platforms like Upwork and managing their freelancing career, as well as suggest improvements to the platforms and to policymakers. If you are interested, we can provide you with a brief summary of our major findings from our completed research study once our research is complete (tentatively August 2025 or earlier), after contacting you via Upwork.\nWe welcome freelancers across experience levels, earnings, and ratings who:\n(i) provide freelancing services on their own (not as part of an agency or company),\n(ii) are over 18 years of age,\n(iii) have provided freelancing services for more than 1 year on Upwork,\n(iv) have worked on freelancing projects in the past 1 year on Upwork (consider July 2022-June 2023 as the past 1 year), and\n(iv) have a Job Success Score on their profile.\nIf you meet all the criteria listed above, please respond to this online survey job posting only if you consent to participating in this survey and allowing us to use certain details from your public Upwork profile for statistical purposes.\nProcedure: In this survey you will not have any more risks than you have in normal life. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board.\nYou will not be personally identified in our analysis or reporting. While storing the data from the survey, a participant ID number will be used instead of your name. However, we will collect some information from your public Upwork profile with your consent (e.g., ratings, job category, total earnings, number of jobs, number of successfully completed jobs and jobs in progress, hourly rate, pricing strategy (fixed vs. hourly), profile title and keywords, number of reviews, type of recognition badge, number of years of educational and work experience, number of skill tags, country, gender, job success score, availability of&nbsp;&nbsp;portfolio, testimonials, certifications, availability badge, and profile video) to understand the difference in freelance experience. Profile information that is captured from your public profile on Upwork with your consent, will be depersonalized for data analysis and reporting so that it is not identifiable with your details and will only be recorded against your participant ID number. These details and your responses will be kept confidential and used for academic purposes only. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board. Data will be stored in a secure academic database on university-licensed cloud storage to ensure confidentiality.\nPlease use a laptop or tablet to complete the survey. We recommend not using mobile.\nCompensation: You will receive $8 for your participation. Kindly note, you will be compensated upon completion of the entire interview as per standard Upwork processes. At the end of the survey, you will be provided with a random ID number (numerical code) that will need to be shared with us on Upwork Message. This will enable us to process your compensation via the Upwork platform, as per standard Upwork processes.\nYou can stop participating in the survey at any time. You may skip the questions, where applicable or use the &lsquo;Not applicable or NA&rsquo;/&lsquo;Not sure&rsquo;/&lsquo;Prefer not to disclose&rsquo; options, or even close the browser to end the survey. While we hope that you will complete the survey, we will compensate you for the first milestone for partial completion of the survey. Your Upwork profile will not be adversely impacted in any way with your participation in the survey, even if you choose to terminate the survey midway as we will provide a 5-star rating without feedback upon completion to preserve the research integrity.\nSurvey time: Approximately 25-30 minutes. The actual time may vary.\nLocation: The survey will be conducted virtually, via an online survey platform and will begin only after you provide your consent.\nFrequency: One-time\nConsent: We will seek your consent electronically at the start of the online survey regarding:\n&bull; Consent to participate\n&bull; Consent to record non-personal information from your public profile without personally identifying you in the data.\nPlease respond to the online survey job posting once you agree with ALL the above requirements.

Ensure that the notification data payload includes a flag indicating that it&#039;s for an incoming call.\n3. Handle Silent Push Notifications in Background\nCreate a background message handler in your main.dart or a relevant file that listens for incoming FCM messages and checks if it&#039;s a call notification.\n4.

Profile information that is captured from your public profile on Upwork with your consent, will be depersonalized for data analysis and reporting so that it is not identifiable with your details and will only be recorded against your participant ID number. These details and your responses will be kept confidential and used for academic purposes only. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board. Data will be stored in a secure academic database on university-licensed cloud storage to ensure confidentiality.\nPlease use a laptop or tablet to complete the survey. We recommend not using mobile.\nCompensation: You will receive $8 for your participation. Kindly note, you will be compensated upon completion of the entire interview as per standard Upwork processes. At the end of the survey, you will be provided with a random ID number (numerical code) that will need to be shared with us on Upwork Message. This will enable us to process your compensation via the Upwork platform, as per standard Upwork processes.\nYou can stop participating in the survey at any time. You may skip the questions, where applicable or use the &lsquo;Not applicable or NA&rsquo;/&lsquo;Not sure&rsquo;/&lsquo;Prefer not to disclose&rsquo; options, or even close the browser to end the survey. While we hope that you will complete the survey, we will compensate you for the first milestone for partial completion of the survey. Your Upwork profile will not be adversely impacted in any way with your participation in the survey, even if you choose to terminate the survey midway as we will provide a 5-star rating without feedback upon completion to preserve the research integrity.\nSurvey time: Approximately 25-30 minutes. The actual time may vary.\nLocation: The survey will be conducted virtually, via an online survey platform and will begin only after you provide your consent.\nFrequency: One-time\nConsent: We will seek your consent electronically at the start of the online survey regarding:\n&bull; Consent to participate\n&bull; Consent to record non-personal information from your public profile without personally identifying you in the data.\nPlease respond to the online survey job posting once you agree with ALL the above requirements.

Our platform provides solutions including transcription, summary creation, and much more, designed to enhance the post-production experience for creators. We are currently looking for an outside agency to help maintain and improve our product.\n **Project Scope**\nThe work can be categorized into two main areas. We&rsquo;d prefer to find an agency that does BOTH, but will also work with agencies that can work on projects without AI experience. \n**Product User Experience and Features Implementation**:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Developing and integrating new features to enhance functionality.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ensuring responsive, consistent design used across the platform.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Refining the user interface and user experience of our existing platform.\n2. **(Optional but preferred experience) AI and Machine Learning**:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Training and improving proprietary AI models to better serve our platform&#039;s needs.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Integrating and optimizing OpenAI Whisper and other models for tasks such as transcription and content generation.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Innovating and implementing AI-driven features to maintain our competitive edge in the market.\n **Technical Expertise Required**\nThe selected agency must demonstrate extensive experience with our technology stack, including but not limited to:\n- **Frontend**: Vue.js/Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS\n- **Authentication**: NuxtAuth (Email/Password + Google)\n- **Backend**: Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL\n- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 for file uploads\n- **Payments**: Integration with Stripe for billing\n- **AI and Machine Learning**: Python proficiency, expertise in machine learning, OpenAI Whisper, and general LLMs. Capability to train and improve AI models is crucial.\n- **Design**: A keen eye for detail, solid understanding of user experience, and high-quality design work.\n **Ideal Agency Profile**\n- **Comprehensive Skill Set**: Capable of addressing both the user experience/product features and the AI/machine learning aspects of the project.\n- **Proven Track Record**: Demonstrated experience in successfully delivering projects with similar technical and creative demands.\n- **Innovative Mindset**: Commitment to leveraging the latest technologies and methodologies to drive product improvement and innovation.\n- **Collaborative Approach**: Ability to work closely with our internal team to ensure seamless integration and alignment with our company&#039;s vision.\n- **Solid Communication**: We expect regular attendance to standup meetings to report progress and blocks. Advanced English speaking skills are required.\n**Upcoming Project Example**\nOne of our upcoming projects on our roadmap is the implementation of an audiogram generator. Here&rsquo;s how it should work:\n- Our AI analyzes the audio content to identify the most engaging and shareworthy snippets within the episode. The system then provides users with timestamps for these segments.\n- With the identified timestamps, the audiogram generator tool should automatically extract the specified audio segments from the main episode.\n- Users should be able customize the visual aspect of the audiogram, including the placement of text, background images, and video if available.\n- The resulting audiogram would be a concise, visually engaging snippet, perfect for sharing on social media platforms, websites, or via email to promote the podcast episode and attract a broader audience.\n **Application Process**\nWe are open to partnerships with agencies specializing in either the product development/user experience domain or the AI/machine learning space. However, preference will be given to companies capable of handling the full spectrum of work described.<b>Skills</b>:        Nuxt.js,                     Vue.js,                     Tailwind CSS,                     Web Application,                     Python,                     AWS Application,                     Machine Learning,                     Transcription Software            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Full-stack-development-for-transcription-company_%7E019e56bf884fc74f8f?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:06:46.527Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 11, 2024 23:16 UTC","id":"019e56bf884fc74f8f"},{"skillset":["Web Application","Web Development","PHP","HTML"],"title":"Art Competition Submission Platform - Upwork","description":"Project Overview:\nThis project aims to develop a web platform for an art competition.

For example, users can adjust the color, size, or position of objects in the photo.\nStyle Transfer: Style transfer algorithms can apply artistic styles from one image to another, allowing users to transform their photos into different artistic styles such as oil paintings, watercolors, or sketches.\nIntelligent Filters and Effects: AI-powered filters and effects can analyze the content of the photo and apply enhancements tailored to the specific characteristics of the image, such as enhancing landscapes, portraits, or low-light conditions.\nReal-Time Suggestions and Enhancements: The app provides real-time suggestions and enhancements to help users improve their photos as they edit. For example, it may suggest adjustments to composition, lighting, or color balance based on AI analysis of the photo.\nCustomization and Personalization: Users can customize and personalize their editing experience by saving their favorite editing presets, creating custom filters, or applying AI-powered effects to create unique looks for their photos.\nIntegration with Cloud Services: The photo editing suite may integrate with cloud storage services to allow users to seamlessly access and sync their photos across multiple devices.

While storing the data from the survey, a participant ID number will be used instead of your name. However, we will collect some information from your public Upwork profile with your consent (e.g., ratings, job category, total earnings, number of jobs, number of successfully completed jobs and jobs in progress, hourly rate, pricing strategy (fixed vs. hourly), profile title and keywords, number of reviews, type of recognition badge, number of years of educational and work experience, number of skill tags, country, gender, job success score, availability of&nbsp;&nbsp;portfolio, testimonials, certifications, availability badge, and profile video) to understand the difference in freelance experience.

We achieve this by using a cloud-based server where the headset and tablet &#039;meet&#039; and share information. To enable this meeting, the tablet must first log on to a local wifi network, and then share those local wifi details with the headset via wifi direct so that the headset can also get online and connect with the server. The tablet does this by first identifying the headsets that are available locally with manufacturer specific MDNS broadcast and then sharing a cloud-based unique identifier based on the serial number of the tablet using unity&#039;s mirror app, and the local SSID that that tablet is on. \nUnder Android 11 our tablet application was able to identify local headsets and share network information easily. That information could be stored and re-used each time after power up and power down.\nHowever, under Android 12 and 13, the new network security settings are blocking the sharing of the wifi and network settings.\nWe are looking to find a consultant who has experience disabling the android 12 &amp;amp; 13 network security settings who can provide guidance to our development team on how to best implement changes to our software code as we migrate from Android 11 to 12 and 13.

The aerodynamic change is consistent with applicable physics, however it introduces an isentropic condition that replaces non isentropic cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstration has been done in test cells and in flight operations. \nExisting turbo machinery code include fluid mechanics constraints that are avoided in this case, and will not normal resolve a solution for the actual performance without altering of other constraints that are not made in the actual tests. \nThe change in performance when considered with the conventional equations for system efficiency including propulsion efficiency and thermodynamic efficiency return problematic results. \nThe existing workaround to explain what the aircraft does is to take known losses from P(ideal), to give an approximation of P(actual), to avoid embarrassment. \nThe mod does not appreciably alter the thermodynamics, but it profoundly alters the propulsion disk performance. The variables at play are limited, only two components of the equations are altered, however the collective change is provable in flight test and the test cell and appears to suggest that a philosophical matter exists. \nThere are distinct differences between propeller and helicopter rotor actuating disk analysis compared to the turbofan case. The turbofan includes pressure ratio v mass-flow constraints that are removed for the fan. This results in far higher thrust for a given case than is otherwise possible. The propeller, rotor and fan all result in a question as to the change in efficiency that is achieved needing to revise the fundamental assumptions of propulsion efficiency that exist. \nDeliverables:\n1. Review of equations of turbomachinery WRT the change that occurs to the demonstrated TSFC and specific thrust achieved. \n2. Assess what term of the equations of efficiency are conflicting with the demonstrated change.\n3.

We trade several $m on crypto.\nWe decided to do REAL HFT too on U.S. market. We both non-fpga hft experts with strategies, backtester, systems.\nWe have a connection from U.S. who could provide us money up to $100m (of course it depends).\nTo be 100% clear, the project would start several months later (once we established the PC (non-fpga) version of the setup). I just search ahead in preparation of this to find the most valuable FPGA developer here (could be you).\nWe are market makers and the structure of dataflow in the system we run (for example on crypto) is the following:\nAll written in C++, running on linux:\nWebsocket (TCP) data | parsing orderbook &amp;amp; trades &amp;amp; order updates let&#039;s say for Bitcoin on binance | Running Strategy, decide if we buy or not (we have strategy) | Sending maker orders to buy/sell HTTPS (TCP) or Websocket (TCP). The system logs to files and we get status about trading on Telegram.\nNow for U.S. equities we would need an FPGA system (where we could plug - in our C++ strategy (I can port that part to HLS). Would be important to use as much C++ as possible, or it can be purely vhdl/verilog if you are able to port strategies from C++. Order management.\nStructure:\nNASDAQ TotalView-ITCH 5.0 format market data in (udp) (orderbook &amp;amp; trades &amp;amp; order updates) | strategy running | sending orders via tcp. And some monitoring would be great (only if it costs just nanoseconds). Order managing is heavily part of it that you would need to write with our help.\nWe can provide network capture files (PCAP) for market data, so it can be decoded into (ITCH 5.0) format while you develop locally. We will try to provide help for order status updates and sending too, and everything you need. But we expect autonomy from you in exploring how to test things properly, we are also open to suggestions.\nWe can give a certain profit split instead of fixed budget for the right person.

While there are several apps that utilize wearable and biometric data and cater to runners, there aren&#039;t any that truly capture the coach/athlete relationship. In place of an expert who can monitor, converse, and provide feedback, many running apps simply use run data and present graphs and tweak plans.\nI&#039;ve built a custom GPT using OpenAI that is trained on contemporary running philosophies and fine tuned to engage in conversation with the goal of understanding an athlete&#039;s goals, experience, limitations, etc. and then provide them with a training plan.\nI have a vision of building a full-scale mobile app but I want to start very small and prove the market-fit before investing more time and money into the effort. For this reason, I hope to work with you to build a bubble.io website that allows the user to chat with the AI, be presented with a 4-week training plan, and then have the option to email that training plan to themselves. The site should also have some monitoring tool (open to suggestions) that can allow for tracking through the process to help me fine tune the different aspects of the MVP.\nMy desired outcome is a very basic site to allow someone to interact with my agent so that I can learn more about market-fit.\nI have some preferences for the styling and interaction but very open to collaboration.\nAbout Me:\nI am professionally a Product Manager for a mobile app for an online university. I recently completed my MBA and am looking for possible business projects to explore. Additionally, I am a lifelong runner and have gotten into ultramarathon distances. The need for good training and incorporating aspects like strength and mobility work in a training plan is the main driver of this project. I run with a big and social running group that continues to provide valuable feedback. \nI look forward to hearing back from you.

However, there is also some content on the site itself, such as a bibliography, and some archived blog posts.\nYou can see the site in it&#039;s current, basic form, here:\nhttps://davegutteridge.com\nI&#039;m hoping to find someone a minimalist style with good use of typography, who can provide a clean, simple, and elegant design.\nI would like to have a picture of myself on the top page, and possibly some other images, such as thumbnails alongside links, but overall the site should use as little imagery as possible for backgrounds and interface.\nThe website is already fully coded with HTML and some PHP. It was NOT made with Wordpress, or Squarespace, or any CMS. It is pure HTML code. It is hosted on a private account on a webhosting service. \nHowever, if you want to use Figma or XD in order to design and share mockups, that is a possibility. I am only partially familiar with XD and Figma, but I am willing to learn about it if it will help you with the design process.\nThe site uses *fully semantic* HTML. This means there are no arbitrary div or span or any other tags just to facilitate a design. The HTML can only be altered if a case can be made that a new tag, class, or ID is accurately descriptive of the content it contains.\nSo the challenge is that most of the design will have to come from CSS. Most of the CSS will be applied globally to the whole site.\nThe design must be responsive so that it is equally accessible on mobile devices and desktop computers. \nI am looking for a freelancer who is more design focused than programming focused.\nThe CSS is in a directory of its own, and the freelancer can include in that directory any additional CSS, image files, or even Javascript in order to execute on their design.\nFTP access will be provided to that directory within a developer version of the site, so that changes can be applied and experimented with, without affecting the actual site.\nThe job will be considered complete when the look and feel of the website is deemed satisfactory.\nWe can agree in advance to how many rounds of revisions.\nPlease respond with a portfolio or examples that demonstrate your style, with particular focus on clean, minimalist designs.\nThank you and I look forward to hearing from you.<b>Skills</b>:        CSS 3,                     Responsive Design,                     User Experience Design,                     UX &amp;

Interior design, Home and Garden info, directory and community website\nTerms - \nMember - An end user of our website\nVendor - A registered business included in our directory who subscribes to the service\nThe idea is to create a website where our 13000+ Facebook group members and vendors can interact away from Facebook. Registered members must log in to use this service. Vendors must subscribe.\nMembers -\nIf logged in as a member, you can communicate with vendors from their profiles using the webform or you can even tender to all vendors in a particular field eg. you are looking for an interior designer to design your master bedroom. You can write the message and select send to all interior designers. \nMembers can also endorse a vendor for a certain skill/qualification similar to linked in eg. an interior designer may have the following skills assigned and endorsed onto them &amp;quot;3D CAD&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;interior design&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;space planning&amp;quot; etc.\nVendor Area-\nEach vendor must pay a subscription fee based on the type of vendor eg. designers pay x, artists pay y . Payment does not have to go through the website. This is done separately.\nThere will also be additional options/addons to enhance the benefits of the vendors.\nVendors can upload images and videos, edit contact details etc in this area.\nThey can pay to be featured in their category and place adverts throughout the website.\nFree Area-\nThe front page of the website shall display some feeds from the facebook group and some recent articles written by content editors. There will be links to the FB group, past newsletters and a few adverts also. \nAnyone can search through our directory of vendors. They should be able to narrow results by vendor type (designer, contractor etc), location, etc. They would be able to view the profiles of vendors and see their contact details, images and trade licenses. \nContent management-\nThere will be an area for a content writer to log in and add content without being a full admin. Preferable to allow integration with FB and Instagram and newsletters. \nCurrent Vendors:\nDetails of current vendors are included in a mysql database. These should be queried and added to the website,\nI want to avoid paying monthly fees for plugins as the costs can rise rapidly for these.

WaveNet, in particular, is known for its ability to generate natural-sounding speech.\nVoice Conversion Techniques: Techniques like voice conversion and speaker adaptation might be used to modify the characteristics of a source speaker&#039;s voice to match those of a target speaker.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): NLP techniques could be used to analyze and understand the text that needs to be converted into speech, ensuring that the generated speech has the correct pronunciation, intonation, and emotion.\nAudio Processing Libraries: Libraries like Librosa or PyAudio could be used for audio signal processing, feature extraction, and manipulation.\nFrameworks and Libraries: They might use popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras for building and training their models.<b>Skills</b>:        API,                     Machine Learning,                     Deep Learning,                     NLP Tokenization            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/want-clone-the-software-behind-ElevenLabs-Voice-Clonging-Technology_%7E013a65b87fe27eecd0?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:09:42.505Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 11, 2024 21:34 UTC","id":"013a65b87fe27eecd0"},{"skillset":["AI-Generated Art","AI Text-to-Image","DALL-E","ChatGPT","AI Text-to-Speech","Midjourney AI","Midjourney Prompt","Adobe Photoshop","AI Image Editing","Photo Editing","Photo Manipulation","Illustration","AI Audio Generation","Adobe Illustrator","Graphic Design"],"title":"LiquidBeans Coffee Extract  - Upwork","description":"Hi, I&#039;m looking for someone to create content for my company on demand.

This class queues and sends audio to Twilio via a websocket. Your job is to extend the class to support real-time background audio.\n1. Add an argument in the constructor `backgroundAudioPath`, then load this file in via `fs`.\n2. Begin sending the audio in chunks to Twilio via `media` websocket messages. Twilio plays audio messages in the order in which they were received, so you&#039;ll want to send `mark` messages to receive a `mark` event when playback for your send messages has completed. Continue sending and maintaining current playback position until the class receives a new `media` message.\n3. Upon receiving a new `media` message, get the current playtime of the background audio, then use ffmpeg (or another solution, if better) to merge the audio. You&#039;ll want to trim the background audio at it&#039;s current playback position, then merge it from there based on the duration of the new audio message (typically a few ms).\n4. Send the merged data to Twilio. Once playback of the merged audio is complete, continue sending the background audio at it&#039;s current play position.\nKeep in mind the latency of processing merged audio using ffmpeg as this may change how audio sounds. Also note that audio sent into the class must be merged and sent sequentially.\nPlease test with Twilio web sockets, docs here: https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream\nGoals:\n1. Background audio should sound continuous to end-users, without interruption.\n2. Input audio (text-to-speech audio) should seamlessly merge over background audio.\n3. This solution is for a realtime voice phone system, so keep latency as close to zero as possible.\nRequired Skills and Qualifications:\n- Strong proficiency in TypeScript and Node.js.\n- Experience with real-time audio processing and streaming.\n- Familiarity with Twilio&#039;s APIs, particularly for audio streaming.\n- Proficiency in using ffmpeg and ffprobe for audio manipulation.\n- Experience with WebSocket communication.\n- Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.\n- Excellent communication and collaboration skills.\nDesirable Skills:\n- Previous experience with audio queue management systems.\n- Knowledge of audio file formats and codecs, particularly WAV and u-law.\n- Experience with stream-based audio processing in Node.js.<b>Skills</b>:        Twilio API,                     Node.js,                     API Integration            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Twilio-Stream-Websocket-Audio-Queue-Management-FFmpeg_%7E0130c948aae72a9722?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:09:42.507Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 22, 2024 16:18 UTC","id":"0130c948aae72a9722"},{"skillset":["React","Amazon EC2","API Integration","API","Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"Improve Latency, Reduce Response Time of Conversational AI (Voice) - Upwork","description":"We have a conversational AI web app that uses voice.\nhttps://digital-friends.com/?character=Heath\nReact app on EC2.\nThis web app is connected via Twilio to we communicated with via a phone number.\nVoice responses are currently averaging around 6 seconds over the phone.\nWe need to get this response time to around 500ms.\nCurrently the LLM API that is returning responses is InWorld who also handle the TTS (Text to Speech) and SST (Speech to Text).\nOne of the ways we think we can increase speed is by implementing:\n https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper\n(for the STT)\nand https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeTTS\n(for the TTS)\nThere may also be other ways and configurations that you can use to help decrease latency.\nThis is a trial project with lots of ongoing work for the best provider.<b>Skills</b>:        React,                     Amazon EC2,                     API Integration,                     API,                     Artificial Intelligence            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Improve-Latency-Reduce-Response-Time-Conversational-Voice_%7E013ce44fad7af81400?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T09:09:42.507Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 22, 2024 02:50 UTC","id":"013ce44fad7af81400"},{"skillset":["Python","API","FFmpeg","AI Text-to-Speech"],"title":"Build a video editing web service to output a final video - Upwork","description":"We want to get help to implement a video editing web service.
