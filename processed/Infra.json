We aim to establish a central virtual server, possibly on DigitalOcean or a similar platform, which can then facilitate secure VPN access to each building&#039;s network infrastructure, including the Teltonika Router, SIM card, Ixon Router, and ultimately the JACE-8000 controller.\n**Requirements:**\n- Experience in setting up and managing VPNs and virtual servers (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, Azure VM, etc.)\n- Knowledge of network security, including firewall configuration and secure access protocols.\n- Familiarity with building automation systems, particularly Niagara 4 and JACE-8000 controllers.\n- Ability to develop web interfaces for easy access and user management.\nPlease share your experience with similar projects and how you would approach this challenge.<b>Skills</b>:        Web Development,                     Database Design            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Remote-access-solution-development-for-building-management-system_%7E01d1a1e14c45d7faa7?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:51:19.380Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 19, 2024 11:15 UTC","id":"01d1a1e14c45d7faa7"},{"skillset":["Python","Django","Vue.js","API Integration","Git","Web Development"],"title":"Full stack developer (Python, Django, Vei.JS) - Upwork","description":"We are currently looking for a Full-stack Python developer to provide technical support for an ongoing project (existing and new functionality implementation, recommendations for improvement, etc.)\nThe site is https://language.online/en/ .

I encourage responses from individuals with prior experience in fulfilling similar requirements.<b>Skills</b>:        Microsoft Windows,                     C#,                     JavaScript,                     .NET Framework,                     API            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Implementing-IIS-Windows-Authentication-within-Ionic-application-integrated-with-Keycloak_%7E017b7919e5f8392287?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:51:42.446Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 29, 2024 07:11 UTC","id":"017b7919e5f8392287"},{"skillset":["VMWare","VMware ESX Server","VMware Administration","Virtual LAN","VMware NSX"],"title":"ESXI NSX expert - Upwork","description":"Hello,\nWe need toconfigure nsx for our Esxi ha infrastructure.\nWe also need nsx loadbalancing install and setup for our ASP.net and iis infrastructure.\nYour job will be to provide us a fully working nsx and loadbalancing.<b>Skills</b>:        VMWare,                     VMware ESX Server,                     VMware Administration,                     Virtual LAN,                     VMware NSX            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/ESXI-NSX-expert_%7E01b98437e536f9b607?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:51:42.446Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 27, 2024 19:58 UTC","id":"01b98437e536f9b607"},{"skillset":["Microsoft Windows","Git","Microsoft IIS","Azure DevOps Server","npm","CI/CD","DevOps","Application Release Automation","Azure DevOps","Microsoft Azure"],"title":"Need to setup Azure DevOps with CICD Integration from Git - Upwork","description":"We&#039;re looking out at setting up Azure DevOps including the Kanban Boards and more importantly the CI/CD setup for using GIT as source and 3 different deployment enviornments viz, local, Client UAT and Live.<b>Skills</b>:        Microsoft Windows,                     Git,                     Microsoft IIS,                     Azure DevOps Server,                     npm,                     CI/CD,                     DevOps,                     Application Release Automation,                     Azure DevOps,                     Microsoft Azure            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Need-setup-Azure-DevOps-with-CICD-Integration-from-Git_%7E011595cf0a861ffa07?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:51:42.446Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 27, 2024 07:53 UTC","id":"011595cf0a861ffa07"},{"skillset":["Web Application","MySQL","Microsoft SQL Server",".NET Framework","ASP.NET","AngularJS","ASP.NET MVC","Oracle Database","Microsoft IIS"],"title":"Participant Contract Information Management System - Upwork","description":"CLIENT is seeking to develop software and hardware to enable its Market Operator perform its Administrative functions in Participant Registration and Information Management and Contract Registration and Information Management as required \nSee attachment for full Technical Requirement Specification<b>Skills</b>:        Web Application,                     MySQL,                     Microsoft SQL Server,                     .NET Framework,                     ASP.NET,                     AngularJS,                     ASP.NET MVC,                     Oracle Database,                     Microsoft IIS            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Participant-Contract-Information-Management-System_%7E0182c2c8607f416a18?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:51:42.446Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 25, 2024 14:53 UTC","id":"0182c2c8607f416a18"},{"skillset":["Bug Tracking &amp;

It was intentional, and we knew the dangers, and now it&rsquo;s time to refactor and modernize ourselves for the next 8 years ahead!\nThe first major project we will seek your leadership on is to modernize our product portfolio.

We are NOT seeking a &lsquo;Team Lead&#039; for this project only, but rather a leader that can help us succeed on this difficult project, as well as provide value beyond that.\nThis project&rsquo;s modernization can be summed up like this:\n- Our Data Center system (you can see it has its own separate login here - https://rayobyte.com/proxy/dashboard/login-type , which uses an entirely separate architecture than the others)\n- Our residential proxy system (separate architecture, login here: https://dashboard.residential.rayobyte.com/user-area/#/login )\n- Scraping Robot (separate architecture, which we want to wrap under the Rayobyte brand going forward:&nbsp;&nbsp;https://dashboard.scrapingrobot.com/ )\nThe end goal would be:\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;All products are under the same architecture, the same user interfaces, same billing systems, and so forth.

My primary goal is to purchase ads on TikTok and Instagram to boost my Instagram reels and promote my TikTok videos. However, I am facing several challenges:\n1. Instagram Reels Boosting Issue: When attempting to boost my reels on Instagram, my real IP location seems to be leaking despite using the VPN. Initially, Instagram was not accepting my credit card payment. I then acquired a residential proxy IP in Brazil and set it up on my VPN, which solved the ISP blocking issue. However, although Instagram now accepts my payment, it doesn&#039;t bill it, and my ads remain in review without any progress.\n2. TikTok Ad Promotion Issue: On TikTok, my payment is accepted, but when I try to select a custom audience for my ad promotion, it automatically selects the United States instead of Brazil. This occurs even though my VPN is set to Brazil, and I have a residential proxy IP with a local Brazilian ISP. My SIM card is also Brazilian. Somehow, TikTok is detecting my actual location.\n3. ChatGPT App Issue: Additionally, the ChatGPT native Android app is not working with my V2Ray VPN setup with a residential proxy IP, indicating that more sophisticated apps can detect my VPN usage.\nYour Task:\nI am seeking an expert to help me resolve these issues so that I can:\n- Successfully boost my reels on Instagram without IP leakage and payment issues.\n- Promote my TikTok videos with the ability to target ads in Brazil, without automatic redirection to the United States.\n- Configure my mobile device in a way that prevents sophisticated apps from detecting my VPN usage, including making the ChatGPT app work with my current setup.\nRequirements:\n- Proven experience in resolving VPN-related issues, especially with V2Ray and residential proxy IPs.\n- Familiarity with social media advertising platforms, particularly Instagram and TikTok.\n- Strong understanding of networking, IP configurations, and mobile device settings.\n- Ability to troubleshoot and provide effective solutions for complex VPN and IP leakage problems.\nIf you have the expertise to help me navigate these challenges and ensure seamless ad purchasing and VPN usage while I&#039;m abroad, please submit your proposal.

The basic idea is to have a large pool of IP addresses that can be used to rotate through different tasks.\nA proxy farm typically includes the following components:\n* A server or cluster of servers: These servers host the proxy farm and manage the IP addresses.\n* Proxies: These are the IP addresses that are used to connect to the internet. They can be purchased or leased from a proxy provider, or they can be created by the proxy farm administrator.\n** Software: Specialized software is used to manage the proxies, assign them to specific tasks, and rotate through them. This software can be custom-built or purchased from a third-party provider**\nHere is a general workflow of how it works:\n1. A user or application requests access to a website or service through the proxy farm\n2. The proxy farm software assigns an available proxy from the pool of IP addresses to the request\n3. The request is sent to the website or service using the assigned proxy IP address\n4. The response is received and passed back to the user or application\n5.
