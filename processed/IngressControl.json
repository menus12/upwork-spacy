The system uses the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern and other custom enhancements to answer legal questions using large database of case histories, court proceedings, rulings, holdings and other documentation. The system also has the capability to summarize legal documents both in overview and in respect of a specific subject.\nWe need a hands-on full stack developer (including most of the following: Pinecone, OpenAI API, Python, FastAPI Server, SQLAlchemy, Sentence Transformers, NodeJS, TypeScript, MySQL, Nginx, Vue2 and Websockets), familiar with LLM (OpenAI, Mistral, Gemini) utilization and deployment, to improve the performance (specifically completion accuracy and utility, not run-time performance) of the system.\nThis is not an advisory role, the selected individual will have responsibility for delivery. Initially, the candidate will be asked to perform a series of fixed price bids to:\n1. Perform a review of the current system. The candidate will review the codebase providing specific insights for improvement and identifying key weaknesses with detailed suggestions for how to address them. This is not a code review, but an architectural assessment of the system and its effectiveness. Success on this task will be judged by the quality of insights provided by the candidates three page report and debriefing presentation.\n2. Improve the performance of retrieval. It has been observed that the recall of document chunks pertinent to a query could be better. The candidate will perform amendments to the codebase to ensure the optional pre-processing and indexing of documents. Success will be measured by achieving an uplift in recall performance of 20% for a small number of test queries and the quality of cited chunks of text for a given query. Credit will be given for further suggestions the candidate might have to improve retrieval performance.\n3. Improve the automated testing (CI/CD) of the platform. The candidate will design and prototype a minimum viable system to enable us to measure key metrics of the system (e.g., retrieval F1@5) allowing us to measure the precise impact of subsequent alterations (e.g., changing the LLM model, changing our document pre-processing, changing the prompt templates). Success will be determined by the effectiveness of the test utilities in comparing the effectiveness of new versions of the system versus baselines.\n4. Improve prompt engineering. Ensure the completions of queries are of high quality, can attribute their answers to relevant sources and can confine their answers to documented facts (as opposed to hallucinated answers or answers from models&rsquo; broader training). Success will be determined by an uplift in hallucination resistance, answer brevity and the ability for the system to correctly report cases where there is no document that supports the query (i.e., the &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo; response).\nSubject to good performance on these tasks, a longer-term role as a senior developer may be offered.\nIn their (brief) proposals, candidates should outline\n- previous relevant experience in similar projects\nreasons why they would be effective in performing the fixed price tasks and the role of senior developer\n- Describe how they would approach the fixed price tasks\n- Provisional quotes for the fixed price tasks (these may be revised once shortlisted candidates have had an introduction to the codebase).\nCandidates with the best proposals will be invited for a technical interview. Thereafter, successful (short listed) candidates will attend a platform briefing before being allowed to review their proposals.<b>Skills</b>:        LLM Prompt,                     OpenAI API,                     FastAPI,                     Websockets,                     Pinecone            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Hands-Developer-Familiar-with-LLM-Utilization-and-Deployment_%7E018f8b3e9944a572b9?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:50:11.598Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 11, 2024 22:17 UTC","id":"018f8b3e9944a572b9"},{"skillset":["JavaScript","PHP","MySQL","NGINX","RESTful API"],"title":"Advanced Ecommerce Checkout Project - Upwork","description":"📙Description:\nWe are seeking a Full Stack Developer specializing in building advanced, scalable and expandable e-commerce checkout systems.
