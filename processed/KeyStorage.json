We are looking for a catching design tailored to music students, parents, teachers and admins. I have attached a bland idea of what we are looking for just to give you an idea- but please use imagination and create something that doesn&#039;t look the same. We really like the aesthetic that Nike gives in their work. If we can include similar features to what Nike is doing that would be great.\nWe are looking for someone to create every page possible that might come up when navigating through this portal with the same branding throughout.\nThe portal will do the following:\n(These are the instructions for the programmer just to give you some insight on what this whole thing will do)\n1. User Management and Portal Login\nSeparate Portals: Create distinct login portals for teachers, students, employees, and parents. Each portal should have role-specific access control to ensure users only access relevant information and functionalities.\nRegistration and Authentication: Implement a secure registration and authentication system for all user types.\n2. Communication Portal\n(think of Slack or Discord when doing this design)\nIntegrated Messaging System (IMS): This will serve as the communication backbone, allowing teachers, students, parents, and employees to interact within their portals. The IMS can include features like direct messaging, announcements, and forums.\n3. Content Management System (CMS)\nProgram Information: Develop a CMS to update and manage content related to the music program, including course descriptions, teacher bios, and event announcements. This should be accessible through the main website to attract potential students.\n4. Lesson Scheduling and Management\nDynamic Lesson Structure: Implement a flexible data table structure to accommodate lesson scheduling for different age groups (K-3rd grade, 3-7th grade, 7th grade and above) with varying requirements.\nRotation and Scheduling Logic: For K-3rd grade, ensure class rotation to avoid missing the same class. For 3-7th grade, adjust the school schedule around music lessons. For 7th grade and above, offer classes at any time, adapting to student availability.\nThree Iterations of Scheduling: Develop scheduling iterations for during school, after school, and weekends, allowing for comprehensive planning.\nStudio-Based Management: Organize schedules and data based on studios rather than individual instructors to centralize information and facilitate easier management.\n5. Registration and Enrollment\nPre-Registration Announcements: Implement a system for sending out pre-registration announcements to gauge interest in various classes.\nDatabase Management: Capture registration information in a database, filtering by timing and demand to assist in reverse teacher assignment based on class needs.\n6. Attendance and Lesson Overview\nAttendance Tracking: Enable teachers to mark attendance digitally, with a feature to input a brief overview of each class&#039;s content.\n7. Invoicing and Commission Calculation\nCentralized Invoicing: Shift invoicing responsibilities from teachers to the school, with the ERP generating invoices based on a commission calculation system.\nAutomated Invoice Distribution: Set up an automated process for invoice distribution directly from the school&#039;s server to parents.\n8. Booking System\nInstrument and Time Slot Selection: Allow parents and students to sign up for lessons by selecting an instrument and a preferred time slot, with the managers assigning teachers based on availability and expertise.\n9. Inventory Management\nK-3 Class Pickup System: Implement an inventory management system to track which K-3 students need to be picked up from their previous class by their music teacher, ensuring smooth transitions between classes.\n10. Ai Implementation\nImplement Ai and Automations wherever possible. Database in which Ai is trained off of that helps teachers and staff with emails, schedules, course content etc..\nPlease send me your portfolio of past works.
