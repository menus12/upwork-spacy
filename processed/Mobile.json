We are implementing limited features similar to Poly.cam house scan. Our project aims at elevating the standards of scanning utilities for residential and commercial spaces. This application promises to be a breakthrough in capturing the dimensions of buildings and rooms and creating floor plans. The app will interact with our servers up and down to recommend certain equipment, and AR-project equipment in real-time. The end result is creating a full documentation and some proposals to share with the client.\nWhat we have now &amp;amp; Enhancements Needed:\n- Room Scanning: Our current App can now scan rooms and floor spaces, covering each room. While we&#039;ve reached this milestone, there&#039;s an opportunity to refine and enhance the overall user experience.\n- Dimension Calculations: Automatic calculation of room dimensions including length, width, and height is functional. \n- Volume &amp;amp; Object Recognition: The app automatically calculates room volume and recognizes windows, doors (with measurements and counts), and wall objects like cabinets and pictures. We&#039;re looking to recognize other objects automatically.\nNew Features to Develop:\n- Design and implement an engaging icon and splash screen, accompanied by secure login functionality.\n- Generate a detailed map and plan of the house, incorporating manual annotations or automatic recognition of wall orientations.\n- Facilitate real-time data exchange with a server, including sending and receiving scans, data, and images.\n- Enable users to superimpose 3D objects in the scanned space accurately and project equipment into the room at scale. Enable capture on-demand\n- Ensure source code delivery post each development milestone, with continuous updates made available through Testflight.\n- Conduct thorough testing, refine based on feedback, and prepare the app for a seamless deployment on the App Store.\nDevelopment Milestones:\nThis project will be segmented into 3 pivotal milestones, with payments disbursed upon the successful completion of each phase. The final milestone will encompass 40% of the total budget, reflecting its significance in finalizing the application for market release.\nDesign and User Access: Completion of app design elements including the icon, splash screen, and secure login.\nAdvanced Scanning Features: Enhancement of existing scanning features and development of new functionalities for comprehensive house mapping.\nServer Interaction and 3D Implementation: Development and integration of server communication protocols, alongside the introduction of 3D object superimposition.\nFinalization and Testing: Extensive testing, revisions as necessary, and preparation for deployment on both Android and iOS platforms.\nBudget &amp;amp; Payment:\nThe total budget for this project will be specified, reflecting the comprehensive nature of the development work. Each milestone payment is designed to incentivize progress and ensure alignment with project goals and timelines.\nTerms:\nThe project is expected to reach completion within 3 weeks.
