But we can work on other themes.\nThe idea is that I send you a brand&#039;s Shopify site to copy. You need to take inspiration from this site, changing the photos, rewording the text (you can use ChatGPT) and creating a product page for me.\nThe tasks are as follows:\n- Creation of the Shopify store\n- Creation of a My Story menu (I&#039;ll send you the image and text to integrate)\n- Creation of a Contact menu (basic)\n- Creation of a Shop menu: And in this menu, only one product.\n- Creation of sections in the legal footer (Terms of sale, Privacy policy, Legal information). Just copy the text and I&#039;ll send you the base.\n- Creating a product page:\nFor the product page, I&#039;ll give you the product name. You&#039;ll need to take inspiration from the competitor&#039;s site for the images and quickly change the name to match our site.\n- Image creation and modification:\nYou&#039;ll modify the product images to match our brand image. Creation of mockups if necessary and creation of product images for integration.\n- Add video if necessary: story type or on the product page.\n- Sections to be created: product price, trust badges; description, press, before/after, real reviews, text+image, presentation GIF, review.\n- Integration of reviews with Stamped Product Review.250 reviews to be integrated as .csv files (I have a French video for this). And I have a basic table for this with reviews.\nSo you can see the sites I want to copy. I&#039;ll show you the reference sites I have.\nExample site:\nhttps://nuebootape.com/products/sticky-insert\nhttps://www.komusodesign.com/products/the-classic-shift\nhttps://eu.oluxring.com/products/ring-1st-gen\nhttps://trtltravel.com/products/trtl-travel-pillow\nBelow 4 sites. I would like product pages of the same quality that are professional, of high quality and with beautiful photos.\nTo summarize, the process is as follows:\nI send you 3 reference sites.\nI give you the product name and a basic image of the product.\nYou search their site for images and text to integrate into our site.\nYou reformulate the text with ChatGpt. you change the name of the images or you change the logo.\nYou create a quality home page, a My Story menu, a contact page, a footer with legal information and a product page as detailed above.\nIt takes me about 10 hours to create my shops. I therefore accept a turnaround time of between 10 and 15 hours maximum.\nI&#039;ll let you propose a price for this work based on your experience.\nOffer me a fixed price for the job.\nI&#039;m looking for someone with experience, to whom I can delegate this part 100%. The goal is to launch 2/3 sites per month. I take care of the research and analysis, and the ads, and you take care of the site.\nIt&#039;s mandatory that you send me sites you&#039;ve done for brands or quality single-product sites.\nIf you&#039;ve only done basic dropshipping or basic sites, there&#039;s no point in applying,\nIf you speak French, that&#039;s a big plus because I&#039;m French. I do speak English, but I have a bit of trouble expressing myself.\nThank you for your help!<b>Skills</b>:        Web Design,                     Shopify,                     Ecommerce Website Development,                     Graphic Design,                     Web Development            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Building-shopify-ecommerce-brand-website_%7E015cc3183bedbd8219?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T20:19:20.758Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 16, 2024 06:51 UTC","id":"015cc3183bedbd8219"},{"skillset":["Search Engine Optimization","eBay Listing","SEO Keyword Research","eBay Marketing"],"title":"eBay Health &amp; Beauty Listing Expert - Upwork","description":"We are seeking an eBay expert to assist with our health &amp;amp; beauty product listings.
