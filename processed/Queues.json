We already have all of the FIGMA + custom built CRM that we are building out the mobile applications now, with the desktop to follow in early 2024.\nA few things of consideration before you submit an application:\n-- Solid Documented Work Experience in ReactJS/React Native + Firebase\n-- Must Provide Your GITHUB to Review Your React Code Quality By Existing Team\n-- Minimum 10k in UPWORK Earnings\n-- Minimum Top-Rated/Plus in UPWORK Experience\n-- Teamwork Towards a Common Goal for Long Term Projects** \n** I am not doing air traffic control between grown adults. I run into this often on these freelancer websites where you can talk and work directly with the other web developer(s) on the team. But instead send messages for me to relay to them, and so forth.

I need a PCB designed for a project that I am working on myself. The major components that I envision to be used in the PCB are:\n1. A microcontroller that preferably has both BLE and WiFi capability. Probable candidates are one of the ESP32 or nordic variants but I am open to suggestions\n2. A PPG sensor. The one I am looking at is the MAX30101 but again I am open to suggestions if you have a cheaper/better option\n3. An integrated battery. This PCB will be used to acquire medical data and should not have any dangling wires, hence the need for a battery. I am open to making this as simple as just popping in one of those small lithium ion batteries used in car remotes etc and replacing them when needed. OR if its not too much of a difference, I am also open to something where the battery can be recharged\n4. This last requirement is not about the PCB itself. I want the PCB to be enclosed in some sort of plastic container to make it a little more presentable in the setting that I will use it in to acquire data\nThese are the major requirements I have. I am basically looking for someone who can first finalize the components and associated circuitry (around the uC or for the battery). And then design a neat double sided PCB with a minimal footprint which can then be sent to some online PCB manufacturer or which I can give to someone locally to have a few copies made.\nWe will probably do a few iterations of this PCB by adding more components and trying to do size reduction and other optimization. I am also open to some support on the microcontroller programming if you are interested but the current description is the starting point. In your proposal to me, please include some details of your plan in terms of what components you are thinking, the estimated timeline and any prior projects which showcase your abilities.\nStudents and new freelancers are welcome to apply as long as they are confident in their ability to handle the above requirements.

Coprocessor itself will execute its code once per 15 minutes and will perform measurement using ultrasonic distance sensor.\nAfter measurement is performed, it will wake up the main PCB and will pass these data to the main ESP32 CPU using RTC_SLOW memory.\nCoprocessor needs to use 2 RTC_GPIO pins for HC-SR04 (or any other such as JSN-SR04T) sensor with Trigger and Echo signals.\nBasically pseudo code, ULP coprocessor needs to execute:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;trigPin = RTC_GPIO_XX\n echoPin = RTC_GPIO_XY\n&nbsp;&nbsp;pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;delayMicroseconds(10); //10 uS pulse\n&nbsp;&nbsp;digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH); //count milliseconds until on that pin is HIGH, timeout 1 second, if nothing measured, save 0 and pass this data to the main CPU\n&nbsp;&nbsp;distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;<b>Skills</b>:        ESP32,                     Firmware,                     Arduino,                     Firmware Programming,                     Embedded System,                     Assembler,                     Assembly Language            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/ESP32-ULP-coprocessor-firmware_%7E01c0e4555cdd045bea?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T20:19:27.471Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 16, 2024 23:47 UTC","id":"01c0e4555cdd045bea"},{"skillset":["C++","C","Encryption","Microsoft Windows","Assembly Language"],"title":"PE Packer x86 x64 for protection and anti reverse - Upwork","description":"I require a proficient programmer to develop a PE packer primarily focused on implementing anti-reversing techniques and compression.

I can be a little flexible on hours, but would usually like someone available from 9-5 or maybe 10-6 my time.

Maybe more.\nA little about me...\nMy desk is covered with stacks of papers - if you&rsquo;re the right fit for this opening, your desk is clutter-free.\nI have to search to find anything (either electronic or paper) - if you&rsquo;re the right fit for this opening, you know where everything is in your life.\nI regularly don&rsquo;t reply in a timely way to correspondence, and it costs me money. And I hate checking email (but I have to). \nDo you love standard operating procedures? Great, because I don&rsquo;t. Not only do I need help following them, but I also need help creating them.\nYou should be one of those who doesn&rsquo;t feel right if all correspondence is not replied to the same day it comes in. \n&hellip; all this being said, I&rsquo;m a pretty successful real estate agent by many definitions. \nNot only am I a real estate agent, but also have a few successful websites. You will be occasionally asked to help out on those websites. Experience with Wordpress would be amazing, but I&rsquo;m happy to train the right candidate. \nI&rsquo;m an ideas person and would love to find someone that can help me execute on my ideas. And sometimes it might be helping launch a new business or website.\nJob Requirements\nA little more about the job...\nIn this job, you will wear many hats. \nYour most IMPORTANT responsibility will be helping my buyers/sellers get from contract to close. \nWhat does that mean? I, as the real estate agent, will get the client under contract, and that&rsquo;s when you take the lead. Documents and contracts are very important. You should be able to handle sending documents, reviewing them for accuracy, and making sure they get where they need to be. \nThere are many important tasks with specific deadlines that need to be followed - you will make sure they are added to the calendar and completed. You will collaborate with clients as well as vendors and other real estate agents to ensure things are on track. \nYour top priority is to provide exceptional customer service throughout the entire closing process, not only our clients, but also to all parties involved. \nAnother daily task is managing new leads into the website. The website gets about 3-7 leads per day. You will use the CRM to process the lead and set it up in our system. That involves categorizing it and setting up the lead to automatically receive real estate listings that match what they are looking for. You will be trained on all of this. \nMarketing will be another important responsibility. You will help me grow my business - whether it be updating websites, pulling lists of people to mail to, preparing newsletters, and more. \nYou may be asked to write content. And you may be asked to design some flyers in Canva. \nOther common tasks include paying bills, adding transactions to Xero, updating status and info of existing leads in the CRM, and preparing listing appointment notes.\nI don&rsquo;t have a big social media presence but I&rsquo;m open to finding someone that help me with that aspect of the business.\nWhat does the ideal candidate look like?\nThe ideal candidate must be adaptable to change and be solutions-oriented. This individual must provide a &ldquo;can-do&rdquo; attitude and will demonstrate initiative in problem-solving.\nYou have a strong sense of urgency, but not at the expense of quality. \nIn addition, you demonstrate on a daily basis the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and habits of a high achiever who is committed to putting clients first, doing the right thing.\nStrong English skills - speaking and writing are critical. You will occasionally be asked to have conversations with agents, clients, and leads.\nSome of the software I use\n(if you don&rsquo;t have experience with some of these programs, don&rsquo;t worry. I will provide training).\nSlack\nGmail\nGoogle Docs / Sheets\nToDoist\nMicrosoft Word / Excel\nAirTable\nDropbox\nNotion\nDotLoop - similar to DocuSign\nCanva\nWordPres\nXero\nDaily Communication:\nWe will mainly communicate via Slack. I&rsquo;m very busy so I don&rsquo;t do daily check-ins. If you are looking for a boss that is checking in with you several times a day, I&rsquo;m not that person. I need someone that can work on there own and knows what needs to be done (once you are trained of course).\nIn your application, please mention your favorite fruit.\nBenefits \nPaid U.S. Holidays\nPaid Vacation / Sick Days<b>Skills</b>:        Real Estate,                     Canva,                     Google Sheets,                     Administrative Support,                     Customer Service,                     Data Entry,                     Email Communication,                     Virtual Assistance,                     Customer Support,                     Communications            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Full-Time-Remote-Assistant-For-Real-Estate-Agent-Entrepreneur_%7E01b83f38b7b913a22c?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T20:19:27.473Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 14, 2024 15:30 UTC","id":"01b83f38b7b913a22c"},{"skillset":["C#","API"],"title":"To Convert a Spot Trading BOT to an Options Trading BOT - Upwork","description":"I have a proven and tested c# desktop BOT for Spot trading thru rest API on the Binance Exchange.\nI want to convert this BOT to trade Options on Binance. \nThe API documentation is here: https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/\nThe current spot trading BOT and the Spec changes are here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vx236271PiWxnEakhpP2fU4huGlqGgl6?usp=drive_link<b>Skills</b>:        C#,                     API            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Convert-Spot-Trading-BOT-Options-Trading-BOT_%7E01aa68f61d1a7d70ba?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T20:19:27.473Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 14, 2024 12:50 UTC","id":"01aa68f61d1a7d70ba"},{"skillset":["Web Design","API Integration","Wix","Payoneer","PayPal","Shopify","Ecommerce Website"],"title":"Shopify Web Developer  - Upwork","description":"I need a simple, minimal and sales-generating website design that will display 10 women&#039;s belt products, and the completion of the relevant Instagram and Meta, WhatsApp business and shopify marketplace integration steps for sales.\nWe have all the content related to this.
