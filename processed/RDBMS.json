Once you begin the survey, you have up to 72 hours to complete it, beyond which time the survey platform will mark your responses as incomplete. Please pay attention to all the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSince many established resources for employees such as organizational support or supervisors do not apply to freelancers, this study intends to help freelancers with strategies to have a better freelancing experience on Upwork or other comparable platforms. We will use your answers to guide new and experienced freelancers on building their profiles on labor platforms like Upwork and managing their freelancing career, as well as suggest improvements to the platforms and to policymakers. If you are interested, we can provide you with a brief summary of our major findings from our completed research study once our research is complete (tentatively August 2025 or earlier), after contacting you via Upwork.\nWe welcome freelancers across experience levels, earnings, and ratings who:\n(i) provide freelancing services on their own (not as part of an agency or company),\n(ii) are over 18 years of age,\n(iii) have provided freelancing services for more than 1 year on Upwork,\n(iv) have worked on freelancing projects in the past 1 year on Upwork (consider July 2022-June 2023 as the past 1 year), and\n(iv) have a Job Success Score on their profile.\nIf you meet all the criteria listed above, please respond to this online survey job posting only if you consent to participating in this survey and allowing us to use certain details from your public Upwork profile for statistical purposes.\nProcedure: In this survey you will not have any more risks than you have in normal life. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board.\nYou will not be personally identified in our analysis or reporting. While storing the data from the survey, a participant ID number will be used instead of your name. However, we will collect some information from your public Upwork profile with your consent (e.g., ratings, job category, total earnings, number of jobs, number of successfully completed jobs and jobs in progress, hourly rate, pricing strategy (fixed vs. hourly), profile title and keywords, number of reviews, type of recognition badge, number of years of educational and work experience, number of skill tags, country, gender, job success score, availability of&nbsp;&nbsp;portfolio, testimonials, certifications, availability badge, and profile video) to understand the difference in freelance experience. Profile information that is captured from your public profile on Upwork with your consent, will be depersonalized for data analysis and reporting so that it is not identifiable with your details and will only be recorded against your participant ID number. These details and your responses will be kept confidential and used for academic purposes only. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board. Data will be stored in a secure academic database on university-licensed cloud storage to ensure confidentiality.\nPlease use a laptop or tablet to complete the survey. We recommend not using mobile.\nCompensation: You will receive $8 for your participation. Kindly note, you will be compensated upon completion of the entire interview as per standard Upwork processes. At the end of the survey, you will be provided with a random ID number (numerical code) that will need to be shared with us on Upwork Message. This will enable us to process your compensation via the Upwork platform, as per standard Upwork processes.\nYou can stop participating in the survey at any time. You may skip the questions, where applicable or use the &lsquo;Not applicable or NA&rsquo;/&lsquo;Not sure&rsquo;/&lsquo;Prefer not to disclose&rsquo; options, or even close the browser to end the survey. While we hope that you will complete the survey, we will compensate you for the first milestone for partial completion of the survey. Your Upwork profile will not be adversely impacted in any way with your participation in the survey, even if you choose to terminate the survey midway as we will provide a 5-star rating without feedback upon completion to preserve the research integrity.\nSurvey time: Approximately 25-30 minutes. The actual time may vary.\nLocation: The survey will be conducted virtually, via an online survey platform and will begin only after you provide your consent.\nFrequency: One-time\nConsent: We will seek your consent electronically at the start of the online survey regarding:\n&bull; Consent to participate\n&bull; Consent to record non-personal information from your public profile without personally identifying you in the data.\nPlease respond to the online survey job posting once you agree with ALL the above requirements.

Script uses the&nbsp;&nbsp;path data in the database to [find or create] those path locations in the filesystem. Script then moves the existing files to those path locations. \nThis script has worked perfectly for 12-14 years WHEN THE PATHNAMES and FILENAMES were all composed of lower/plain ASCII characters. \nNow PATHNAMES and FILENAMES need to allow upper ASCII characters such as &auml;, &Oslash;, etc. [Scandinavian and common European characters]. The OLD Perl script was from well before the time that Perl was built to do character encoding well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure, but I *think* Perl is INTERNALLY using some ISO-8859 encoding (or something else???) instead of UTF-8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The input data (filenames and paths) from Oracle is UTF-8. The existing files in the&nbsp;&nbsp;linux filesystem are UTF-8 names.&nbsp;&nbsp;The output needs to be UTF-8 to [find create] the target directory names (paths) and then move the exiting files into those directories.\nWe are NOT currently able to upgrade the Perl version.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to either use (with the same script) either 5.10.1 or 5.30.0.on the systems we have.&nbsp;&nbsp;[This aspect cannot be changed at this time; we are planning on a long-term total replacement in the next two years.]\nInstead, we either have to...\n1) Add an ENCODE Perl module (and how to use it?) to the existing Perl installation(s) (Perl 5.10.01 on Ubuntu Linux 10.04.4) OR (Perl 5.30.0 on Ubuntu Linux 20.04). [Both access the same Oracle 8.x database.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Oracle database and the Linux use UTF-8 encoding.\nOR \n2) Modify the process that the script does and INSTEAD of the script CURRENTLY directly adding paths and files to the filesystem, change the script to instead write out a script-text-file containing &amp;quot;install&amp;quot; command lines. [I have an &amp;quot;install&amp;quot; command example that does work, which we use for something else.] Then I can use an &amp;quot;iconv&amp;quot; command to convert that script-text-file from ISO-8859 (???) to UTF-8.\nThis project is best done by somebody familiar with older Perl versions *and* character encoding problems.\nThough the Perl script is communicating with an old Oracle database, that part is working okay and does not need any changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do *NOT* think that this project requires any Perl:DBI, Oracle, or PL/SQL skills as long as no changes are made to that part of the script. \nThis could be hourly work or a a fixed price job.

It replaces traditional passwords with a smart, easy, and highly secure method based on a table of icons. \n**Key Features:**\n1. **User Registration**: Users create an account by entering a username and selecting their preferred icons from a table.\n2. **Icon Shuffle at Login**: During the login process, these icons are randomly shuffled. Users authenticate by entering their username and the locations of their selected icons.\n3. **Enhanced Security**: The app is immune to keyloggers, phishing, and other common cyber attacks. It does not store explicit or hashed passwords, rendering brute force and rainbow table attacks ineffective.\n4. **Privacy and Data Security**: In the event of a database breach, the stored data is unusable on other websites, providing an additional layer of security.\n**Advantages Over Traditional Passwords:**\n- User-friendly and easier to remember.\n- Resistant to various hacking methods including brute force, keylogging, phishing, and shoulder surfing.\n- Easily integrable with various systems.\n- Highly relevant in the current landscape of increasing cyber attacks.\n**Applications:**\nPassNumber is versatile and can be integrated with:\n- Various website platforms (PHP, ASP .NET, Java).\n- Operating systems (Windows, MAC, Linux).\n- Enterprise Management Systems (EMS) like Alfresco and SharePoint.\n- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms such as Oracle, Salesforce, and Zendesk.\n**Project Goals:**\n- Develop a fully functional PassNumber application.\n- Ensure compatibility with multiple platforms and systems.\n- Prioritize user experience and security in design and functionality.\n**Why This Project is Promising:**\n- It&#039;s an open-source GPL3 licensed project (GitHub link).\n- Targets a global audience across various industries.\n- Addresses a crucial need in personal and business information security.\n**What We Are Looking For:**\nAn experienced developer with:\n- Expertise in application security and user authentication methods.\n- Proficiency in cross-platform development.\n- Ability to work collaboratively, incorporating feedback and aligning with the project vision.\n**Project Timeline and Budget:**\n1-3 Months, up to 500$ (negotiable).\nIf you are passionate about creating innovative solutions in the cybersecurity space and have the skills to bring PassNumber to life, we would love to collaborate with you on this ground breaking project.<b>Skills</b>:        Laravel,                     JavaScript,                     PHP,                     Web Development,                     HTML,                     CSS,                     HTML5,                     Android App,                     iOS Development            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Development-PassNumber-Revolutionary-Image-Based-Authentication-App_%7E01810a61ad9bc6e782?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:47:52.343Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 09, 2024 11:40 UTC","id":"01810a61ad9bc6e782"},{"skillset":["API","API Development","Oracle Forms","Oracle Database"],"title":"Oracle Forms 6i and Oracle DB 11g developer  - Upwork","description":"Hi,\nI am looking for a someone who can customize an existing POS (Billing system) build on Oracle Forms 6i and DB 11g to make an API integration from this system. \nThe API will contain the JSON data of the invoice and when send to the server as POST request will get a QR in response, this QR Code needs to be displayed on the invoice report (the invoice that needs to be printed from the POS).

Once you begin the survey, you have up to 72 hours to complete it, beyond which time the survey platform will mark your responses as incomplete. Please pay attention to all the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSince many established resources for employees such as organizational support or supervisors do not apply to freelancers, this study intends to help freelancers with strategies to have a better freelancing experience on Upwork or other comparable platforms. We will use your answers to guide new and experienced freelancers on building their profiles on labor platforms like Upwork and managing their freelancing career, as well as suggest improvements to the platforms and to policymakers. If you are interested, we can provide you with a brief summary of our major findings from our completed research study once our research is complete (tentatively August 2025 or earlier), after contacting you via Upwork.\nWe welcome freelancers across experience levels, earnings, and ratings who:\n(i) provide freelancing services on their own (not as part of an agency or company),\n(ii) are over 18 years of age,\n(iii) have provided freelancing services for more than 1 year on Upwork,\n(iv) have worked on freelancing projects in the past 1 year on Upwork (consider July 2022-June 2023 as the past 1 year), and\n(iv) have a Job Success Score on their profile.\nIf you meet all the criteria listed above, please respond to this online survey job posting only if you consent to participating in this survey and allowing us to use certain details from your public Upwork profile for statistical purposes.\nProcedure: In this survey you will not have any more risks than you have in normal life. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board.\nYou will not be personally identified in our analysis or reporting. While storing the data from the survey, a participant ID number will be used instead of your name. However, we will collect some information from your public Upwork profile with your consent (e.g., ratings, job category, total earnings, number of jobs, number of successfully completed jobs and jobs in progress, hourly rate, pricing strategy (fixed vs. hourly), profile title and keywords, number of reviews, type of recognition badge, number of years of educational and work experience, number of skill tags, country, gender, job success score, availability of&nbsp;&nbsp;portfolio, testimonials, certifications, availability badge, and profile video) to understand the difference in freelance experience. Profile information that is captured from your public profile on Upwork with your consent, will be depersonalized for data analysis and reporting so that it is not identifiable with your details and will only be recorded against your participant ID number. These details and your responses will be kept confidential and used for academic purposes only. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board. Data will be stored in a secure academic database on university-licensed cloud storage to ensure confidentiality.\nPlease use a laptop or tablet to complete the survey. We recommend not using mobile.\nCompensation: You will receive $8 for your participation. Kindly note, you will be compensated upon completion of the entire interview as per standard Upwork processes. At the end of the survey, you will be provided with a random ID number (numerical code) that will need to be shared with us on Upwork Message. This will enable us to process your compensation via the Upwork platform, as per standard Upwork processes.\nYou can stop participating in the survey at any time. You may skip the questions, where applicable or use the &lsquo;Not applicable or NA&rsquo;/&lsquo;Not sure&rsquo;/&lsquo;Prefer not to disclose&rsquo; options, or even close the browser to end the survey. While we hope that you will complete the survey, we will compensate you for the first milestone for partial completion of the survey. Your Upwork profile will not be adversely impacted in any way with your participation in the survey, even if you choose to terminate the survey midway as we will provide a 5-star rating without feedback upon completion to preserve the research integrity.\nSurvey time: Approximately 25-30 minutes. The actual time may vary.\nLocation: The survey will be conducted virtually, via an online survey platform and will begin only after you provide your consent.\nFrequency: One-time\nConsent: We will seek your consent electronically at the start of the online survey regarding:\n&bull; Consent to participate\n&bull; Consent to record non-personal information from your public profile without personally identifying you in the data.\nPlease respond to the online survey job posting once you agree with ALL the above requirements. If you have any more questions, you can contact the primary researchers through Upwork Message.<b>Skills</b>:        Software Integration,                     Business Applications Development,                     CRM Development,                     Dashboard,                     Demand Planning,                     Service Management Software,                     Human Resource Information System,                     Automated Workflow,                     Accounting Software,                     HubSpot,                     Marketo,                     Salesforce CRM,                     CRM Software,                     ERP Software,                     Marketing Automation Software,                     Microsoft Dynamics 365,                     Office 365,                     Oracle NetSuite,                     SAP CRM,                     SAP ERP,                     Java,                     .NET Framework,                     SQL,                     PHP,                     Python,                     C#,                     CSS,                     HTML5            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Participate-Academic-Survey-Reflect-your-Freelancing-Experience-DR115_%7E0176dd20e42baaf799?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:47:52.344Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 27, 2024 14:26 UTC","id":"0176dd20e42baaf799"},{"skillset":["Microsoft SQL Server","C#"],"title":"Send Signal App Messages using SQL Server Table - Upwork","description":"We are looking for a skilled freelancer who can help us send Signal App messages using a SQL Server table.

I run into a problem in creating this loader. \nYOU HAVE TO READ THE WHOLE TASK AND KNOW THE ANSWER BEFORE YOU PROPOSE. YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY BLACKLISTED IF YOU PROPOSE WITHYOUT READHING IT.\nI am writing a .NET 6.0 console app that uses reflection to\n- Load an arbitrary class library (DLL) - I can&#039;t predict what DLL the end user may load - the possibilities are infinite.\n- Find out its public types and the methods of each type.\n- Invoke its methods.\nFor the loaded assembly to work, my app needs to load the whole dependency graph - all of its dependencies and the dependencies of each dependency and so on recursively. For each of the dependency which is itself a DLL, if it is not in the global NuGet packages folder, my app downloads it from NuGet online library and unzips it into the global folder.\nIs this the right approach? Or is there a fundamentally better approach?\nA problem I encountered is how to pick the right DLL in the NuGet package folder.\nIn my testing, the target DLL which my console app tried to load and invoke uses Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 7.0.16 to talk to a SQL Server database. It has a dependency Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 5.1.4. Inside the NuGet package folder of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 5.1.4, there are the following subfolders that each contains a Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.dll:\nlib\\net6.0\nlib\\net462\nlib\\netstandard2.0\nlib\\netstandard2.1\nruntimes\\win\\lib\\net6.0\nruntimes\\win\\lib\\net462\nruntimes\\win\\lib\\netstandard2.0\nruntimes\\win\\lib\\netstandard2.1\nYou would think that the one in &amp;quot;lib\\net6.0&amp;quot; has to be the right one, because my console app targets .NET 6.0, wouldn&#039;t you? But if my console app loads this one, it would case a exception saying this DLL is not supported. However, if I use the one in &amp;quot;runtimes\\win\\lib\\netstandard2.0&amp;quot;, everything works.\nSo the question is: where is the knowledge that I should use the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.dll in folder &amp;quot;runtimes\\win\\lib\\netstandard2.0&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;lib\\net6.0&amp;quot; for Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 7.0.16?\nThe following is how to get dependencies of a given DLL. It doesn&#039;t contain the knowledge I am after:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NuspecReader nuspecReader = await packageReader.GetNuspecReaderAsync(cancellationToken);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreach (var dependencyGroup in nuspecReader.GetDependencyGroups())\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreach (NuGet.Packaging.Core.PackageDependency packageDependency in dependencyGroup.Packages)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]\nHowever, Visual Studio secretly knows where to get this knowledge, because if I add a reference to Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 7.0.16 in any .Net 6.0 project, Visual Studio will automatically pick the right Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.dll in the global NuGet packages folder.\nBut where is this knowledge, so my console app can use to load the right DLL?\nSo, if you know the answer, then you can implement the following method, which acquires the knowledge which I don&#039;t know where to acquire, then use it to get the right version of DLL to use.\npublic static List[string] GetDependencyFiles(string packageID, string packageVersion)\n[\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// your implemetation\n]\nWhen I call this function like this:\nvar dependencyFiles = GetDependencyFiles(&amp;quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;7.0.16&amp;quot;);\nOne of the returned strings should be &amp;quot;C:\\Users\\frank\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.data.sqlclient\\5.1.4\\runtimes\\win\\lib\\netstandard2.0\\Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.dll&amp;quot;.<b>Skills</b>:        C#,                     .NET Framework,                     .NET Core            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Expert-wanted-NET-runtime-dependency-resolution_%7E014c371fe82cdcaf03?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:47:58.285Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 16, 2024 05:40 UTC","id":"014c371fe82cdcaf03"},{"skillset":["SQL"],"title":"SQL Project - Upwork","description":"Entry Level SQL project there is a guideline that it will be graded on a instructional video.\nThis is the URL to the Video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRHEIkpON34&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be<b>Skills</b>:        SQL            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/SQL-Project_%7E017650923cd4e13c71?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:47:58.285Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 16, 2024 03:09 UTC","id":"017650923cd4e13c71"},{"skillset":["API","RESTful API",".NET Framework","C#","Software Architecture &amp; Design","Microsoft SQL Server"],"title":"Need .NET/backend developer to develop scalable, maintainable and secured APIs - Upwork","description":"Title: Experienced .NET C# Developer Needed for API Development Project\nDescription:\nWe are seeking a skilled and experienced .NET C# developer to assist us in developing an API adhering to the best practices in the industry.

Once you begin the survey, you have up to 72 hours to complete it, beyond which time the survey platform will mark your responses as incomplete. Please pay attention to all the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSince many established resources for employees such as organizational support or supervisors do not apply to freelancers, this study intends to help freelancers with strategies to have a better freelancing experience on Upwork or other comparable platforms. We will use your answers to guide new and experienced freelancers on building their profiles on labor platforms like Upwork and managing their freelancing career, as well as suggest improvements to the platforms and to policymakers. If you are interested, we can provide you with a brief summary of our major findings from our completed research study once our research is complete (tentatively August 2025 or earlier), after contacting you via Upwork.\nWe welcome freelancers across experience levels, earnings, and ratings who:\n(i) provide freelancing services on their own (not as part of an agency or company),\n(ii) are over 18 years of age,\n(iii) have provided freelancing services for more than 1 year on Upwork,\n(iv) have worked on freelancing projects in the past 1 year on Upwork (consider July 2022-June 2023 as the past 1 year), and\n(iv) have a Job Success Score on their profile.\nIf you meet all the criteria listed above, please respond to this online survey job posting only if you consent to participating in this survey and allowing us to use certain details from your public Upwork profile for statistical purposes.\nProcedure: In this survey you will not have any more risks than you have in normal life. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board.\nYou will not be personally identified in our analysis or reporting. While storing the data from the survey, a participant ID number will be used instead of your name. However, we will collect some information from your public Upwork profile with your consent (e.g., ratings, job category, total earnings, number of jobs, number of successfully completed jobs and jobs in progress, hourly rate, pricing strategy (fixed vs. hourly), profile title and keywords, number of reviews, type of recognition badge, number of years of educational and work experience, number of skill tags, country, gender, job success score, availability of&nbsp;&nbsp;portfolio, testimonials, certifications, availability badge, and profile video) to understand the difference in freelance experience. Profile information that is captured from your public profile on Upwork with your consent, will be depersonalized for data analysis and reporting so that it is not identifiable with your details and will only be recorded against your participant ID number. These details and your responses will be kept confidential and used for academic purposes only. This study has been approved by the researchers&#039; institutional research ethics board. Data will be stored in a secure academic database on university-licensed cloud storage to ensure confidentiality.\nPlease use a laptop or tablet to complete the survey. We recommend not using mobile.\nCompensation: You will receive $8 for your participation. Kindly note, you will be compensated upon completion of the entire interview as per standard Upwork processes. At the end of the survey, you will be provided with a random ID number (numerical code) that will need to be shared with us on Upwork Message. This will enable us to process your compensation via the Upwork platform, as per standard Upwork processes.\nYou can stop participating in the survey at any time. You may skip the questions, where applicable or use the &lsquo;Not applicable or NA&rsquo;/&lsquo;Not sure&rsquo;/&lsquo;Prefer not to disclose&rsquo; options, or even close the browser to end the survey. While we hope that you will complete the survey, we will compensate you for the first milestone for partial completion of the survey. Your Upwork profile will not be adversely impacted in any way with your participation in the survey, even if you choose to terminate the survey midway as we will provide a 5-star rating without feedback upon completion to preserve the research integrity.\nSurvey time: Approximately 25-30 minutes. The actual time may vary.\nLocation: The survey will be conducted virtually, via an online survey platform and will begin only after you provide your consent.\nFrequency: One-time\nConsent: We will seek your consent electronically at the start of the online survey regarding:\n&bull; Consent to participate\n&bull; Consent to record non-personal information from your public profile without personally identifying you in the data.\nPlease respond to the online survey job posting once you agree with ALL the above requirements. If you have any more questions, you can contact the primary researchers through Upwork Message.<b>Skills</b>:        SQLite,                     Realm Database,                     MongoDB,                     MySQL,                     Apache Cassandra,                     API,                     Database,                     Database Architecture,                     Software Architecture &amp; Design,                     Data Access Layer,                     RESTful API,                     PHP Script,                     Python Script,                     SOAP API,                     Business Logic Layer,                     Database Maintenance,                     Ruby,                     C++,                     ASP,                     Django,                     SaaS,                     PyTorch,                     TensorFlow,                     Atlassian Bamboo,                     AWS Amplify,                     Azure DevOps            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Participate-Academic-Survey-Reflect-your-Freelancing-Experience-DR139_%7E01162610657fc5f5fb?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:04.372Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 12, 2024 13:43 UTC","id":"01162610657fc5f5fb"},{"skillset":["PostgreSQL","SQLite","MySQL","SQL","Amazon Web Services","Amazon RDS"],"title":"Help me connect to a hosted database - Upwork","description":"I&#039;m an engineer with little backend experience.

Assess and Plan the Migration\nPerform a thorough assessment of the existing SQLite database schema, relationships, and data types.\nIdentify any SQLite-specific features or data types that may require special handling or conversion for PostgreSQL.\nPlan the migration process, including timing, necessary downtime, backup strategies, and testing phases.\n2. Prepare the PostgreSQL Environment\nInstall and configure the PostgreSQL server, ensuring it is optimized for the expected data volume and access patterns.\nCreate the necessary databases, schemas, and roles with appropriate permissions in PostgreSQL.\nReview and apply security settings, including access controls and encryption as needed.\n3. Data Type Mapping and Schema Conversion\nMap SQLite data types to their PostgreSQL equivalents, taking care to handle any incompatible types or those that might affect performance differently in PostgreSQL.\nConvert the SQLite schema to a PostgreSQL-compatible schema, including tables, indexes, views, and triggers. Utilize tools or scripts to automate this process where possible.\n4. Data Migration\nUse a migration tool like pgLoader, which can directly transfer data from SQLite to PostgreSQL, handling schema and data type conversion automatically.\nIn cases requiring manual intervention or custom scripting, ensure scripts are thoroughly tested on a subset of data before full-scale migration.\nImplement data validation checks during the migration to ensure data integrity and consistency.\n5. Testing and Validation\nPerform comprehensive testing on the PostgreSQL database to verify data integrity, including checks for missing data, data corruption, or any discrepancies.\nTest the performance of the new database with realistic workloads and queries to ensure it meets or exceeds the performance of the old system.\nInvolve end-users or stakeholders in testing applications or reports that rely on the database to confirm that functionality remains unchanged or improved after the migration.\n6. Finalize the Migration\nPlan for a final synchronization of any data changes that occurred in the SQLite database during the migration process.\nOnce confirmed, switch over applications and users to the new PostgreSQL database.\nMonitor the system closely for any issues related to performance, security, or data integrity in the days following the migration.\n7. Post-Migration Cleanup and Documentation\nDecommission the old SQLite database after ensuring all data and functionality have been successfully migrated and backed up.\nUpdate any documentation to reflect the new database architecture, data flow, and any changes in access or security protocols.\nProvide training or resources to the team on PostgreSQL features or administration as needed.\n# Conclusion\nMigrating over 1 million records from SQLite to PostgreSQL is a complex task requiring careful planning, execution, and testing.

We need our database to be modified and new interfaces/api&rsquo;s created so we no longer need excel files. I&rsquo;ll explain the excel files below.\nCurrently we use two excel files to gather content about schools and clients. I will share those files with entities we&rsquo;d like proposals from after NDAs are signed. We&rsquo;ll also give access to our source code and portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWe use the two excel files to conduct analyses and assess what we need to accomplish in order to reach various goals. These are very basic analyses. We are not a financial services or healthcare organization with millions of dynamic data points and circular, complex equations. We have worked with 1300 clients to date and gather content on approximately 80 schools per year. The information that is in the excel files is also in our portal &ndash; it&rsquo;s manually duplicated into the database. This has been the solution to date because we are not able to manipulate and analyze the content that is in the portal database. \nWe are also not able to easily see what content needs to be gathered as it regards school data from one year to the next when we look at school data in our portal, as we are looking at school profile tabs, not a database that we can manipulate and see at a micro and macro scale. \nWith the school data file, we must verify/update the data every year, throughout the year, as schools do not release all data at once. Further, schools don&rsquo;t publish content in the same place on their websites annually. We have to scour sites to find data and, at times, call schools for the data. What we do is highlight all cells grey in May. Then, as we get the new season&rsquo;s data, we remove the highlight from the cell. So it is very easy for us to know what data is last year vs this year. The solution must give us the ability to sort and filter as one does in Excel. It must allow us to highlight cells, which, upon being highlighted, will turn text in the portal profile tabs red so we can easily see, whether in the database or the portal school profile tabs, if content is new or old. We must be able to edit the content in the database interface or in the portal school profile pages.\nWith the client data and results file, the content is currently in an excel file because we need the ability to look at our current clients and past clients all at once. We need to often look at our track record and manipulate data to understand what results we need - for example, how many more clients must get an interview or offer &ndash; to cross a certain success threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also conduct analyses to understand many things (how many clients attended a certain college, were over 32 years old, had a GPA between 2.5-3.0, were male, from West Point, attended HBS, etc). We must be able to edit the content in the database interface or in the portal client profile pages.\nWe need the ability to filter/sort just as we do with excel files. We need to be able to track various metrics, such as how many people get interviews, offers, scholarships, average scholarship amount, number of females that get offers vs males who get offers, females that get scholarships vs males who get scholarships, etc.<b>Skills</b>:        MariaDB,                     Database Design,                     PHP Script,                     Back-End Development,                     Laravel,                     PHP,                     Database,                     MySQL,                     RESTful API            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Need-backend-developer-modify-add-functionality-our-existing-database_%7E01607efd4f3f9695f1?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:10.311Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 12, 2024 16:53 UTC","id":"01607efd4f3f9695f1"},{"skillset":["MariaDB","Node.js","jQuery","JavaScript","Bootstrap","Jinja2","ERPNext","Python"],"title":"Frappe ERPNext Expert - Upwork","description":"Bond is seeking a senior level developer who is looking to join a small, fast paced, remote, team.
