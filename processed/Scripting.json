This editor is mostly lua, very configurable. I don&#039;t have time to read the api and understand how to config it properly.\nI want this particular lsp: https://github.com/zk-org/zk. I&#039;ve tried marksman and it chocked on relatively small notebook sizes.\nTo use it, install it (a single binary, put it on your local/bin path) and run zk init on a folder with lots of markdown files. It will take a while to index them. Attached is an example test folder.\nTextadept does support lsps, but the manual is kinda skimpy on the details. https://github.com/orbitalquark/textadept-lsp\nThe instructions for lua and python don&#039;t seem to work :\nhttps://github.com/orbitalquark/textadept/wiki/LSP-Configurations\nOne thing I&#039;ve figured out is that TA will need to know what is a project to run the lsp. A project is defined as a folder with a version control file in it. That simple.\nWhat I need:\n- Automatic autocompletion of filenames [[. That is, typing this on TA will show a dropdown list with filenames in the folder(recursive). And as I type the list is narrowing down\n- The list completion doesn&#039;t break when I type spaces. My filenames have spaces, this has to be robust to it. Helix does this well, other editors don&#039;t. They expect the autocompletion to be function names in a programming language, which don&#039;t have spaces in their names. I don&#039;t know how textadept does it (if it&#039;s robust to filenames in the name or not). You would have to look at the lsp module code, and fix it there if it&#039;s not respecting spaces as part of the names.\n- Goto definition. Pressing a shortcut will open the file. Optional: on a newly created vsplit.\n- References. I want to see which files link to the current one\nAll those features are built in with textadept lsp module, I just don&#039;t have the time to play around with it till I get it to work.\nI know this is a basic task for a lua programmmer (mostly config), I&#039;m sorry.\nI will commission many tasks to customize textadept (it&#039;s a core part of a project I&#039;m working on). So any time you spend understanding its api will pay off later.

The main objective is to develop a small island that expands over time as players complete specific tasks. Here&#039;s a breakdown:\n1: Players must complete a circuit to collect coins. This circuit will feature obstacles that players need to navigate, jump over, and overcome to collect coins. You can refer to the Roblox tutorial provided at (https://create.roblox.com/docs/pt-br/tutorials/core), or utilize a pre-existing template, or create your own. Once players have gathered the coins and returned to the main island, the next step is to battle a crazy robot.\n2: The crazy robot will be situated within a small arena at the center of the island. When a player approaches the arena, they automatically initiate a battle with the robot. Feel free to employ any design and Lua script for this segment. The aim is to create a simple and fast-paced robot battle within the game.\n3: Once the player defeats the robot, a window will appear allowing the player to utilize the collected coins to purchase additional land. Upon acquiring more land, the island expands.\nThis game cycle repeats endlessly.\nAfter the game is completed, I would appreciate receiving both the link to the game hosted online on Roblox and the game source files.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, please create a new account specifically for hosting the game online and pass to me both the username and the password.<b>Skills</b>:        Roblox Studio,                     Smartphone,                     Tablet,                     Game Development            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Small-Roblox-Game-Development_%7E0175bf7ce6fd15aecf?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:45.853Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 15, 2024 17:59 UTC","id":"0175bf7ce6fd15aecf"},{"skillset":["Lua"],"title":"Lua Script Expert - Upwork","description":"Hi how are you?\nI have some lua script files, I believe they are from version 5.0.2 or something close to that.\nI need a dev who is capable of building a lua dec/comp for me.\nSo I can see, edit the lua code and also run it.\nIn the attached folder you will find:\n1- Original Folder: contains some original luas scripts.\n2- Code folder: contains the translated/dec luas scripts.\n3- Software folder: contains some programs that were supposed to do luadec/comp work, but I never managed to make them work.\nI believe that if you can compare the original file with the translated file, it is possible to create lua dec/comp.\nIf you can do it, send me a message and the job is yours.\nDownload here: https://www.transfernow.net/dl/20240314YrD2cweI\nThanks!<b>Skills</b>:        Lua            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Lua-Script-Expert_%7E01fbf2023f3d13e05c?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:45.853Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 14, 2024 15:19 UTC","id":"01fbf2023f3d13e05c"},{"skillset":["Web Development"],"title":"Site developer - betting games - Upwork","description":"Develop a website in the style of a betting house with some specific games.\nI have a website template to follow.\nI prefer someone who has already made websites in this same niche.<b>Skills</b>:        Web Development            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Site-developer-betting-games_%7E01715ed7e6e73a9b08?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:45.853Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 14, 2024 12:55 UTC","id":"01715ed7e6e73a9b08"},{"skillset":["Game Design","Game Development","Unity","Unreal Engine","3D Game Art"],"title":"Roblox Game Development - Upwork","description":"For anyone that understands Roblox games I am looking to make a Roblox Simulator.

The radioEXT mod has two dependencies, CET and Red4Ext. If possible it&#039;d be great to remove the need for LUA, so it just depends on Red4Ext. Or, even better, have the whole thing written in redscript, negating the need for any dependencies at all.\nSuccessful applicants will have the following skills:\n-Proven record of modding games, preferably Cyberpunk 2077 (please send links to previous projects).\n-Good written English\n-Skills in C++ / Redscript / LUA\n**IMPORTANT NOTE\nThis mod must be programmed from scratch so I have full ownership to modify and distribute it. Taking the existing mod and making the required changes would not be sufficient, and I will review source code before payment to confirm this is not the case. <b>Skills</b>:        Microsoft Windows,                     Role-Playing Game,                     C++,                     Lua,                     Game Development,                     C            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-radio-mod-for-Cyberpunk-2077-LUA_%7E018d2b1ec4805b18b2?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:45.854Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 23, 2024 14:03 UTC","id":"018d2b1ec4805b18b2"},{"skillset":["Web Application","TypeScript","Node.js","JavaScript","Discord","Discord Bot Development","Server","Game Customization","Lua","FiveM","CMS Framework"],"title":"FiveM Development - Upwork","description":"Looking for possible Devs to work on a FiveM server from scratch, ongoing work.<b>Skills</b>:        Web Application,                     TypeScript,                     Node.js,                     JavaScript,                     Discord,                     Discord Bot Development,                     Server,                     Game Customization,                     Lua,                     FiveM,                     CMS Framework            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/FiveM-Development_%7E01a4c28fdf6b2b7716?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:45.854Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 23, 2024 05:56 UTC","id":"01a4c28fdf6b2b7716"},{"skillset":["RFID","Antenna Design","RF Design","Electrical Engineering"],"title":"Expert RFID Engineer with significant antenna configuration experience - Upwork","description":"We are working with a small RFID company that uses custom built RFID readers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The readers run Impinj R-2000 chips.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our readers are sitting within smaller containers containing 1,000 - 2,000 passive tags with 32 available antennas connected to the reader.\nWe are struggling to have our devices consistently read all of our tags.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our belief is that a combination of the scanner timing, sequencing, and power settings are likely incorrect, but we do not have the necessary experience to dial these in as necessary.\nWe are looking for a person who can analyze the geometry of our environment, recommend the most ideal tags for us to use, help us to adjust the settings accordingly, and otherwise recommend the strategies we should follow in order to get the most our of our environment.\nThe Edge devices responsible for communicating with the Readers were unfortunately originally coded in Lua.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the process of porting this to C/C++, but can likely modify the existing code sufficiently if there are specific chipset functions that we may need to consider.\nThe applicant would be provided with all necessary details related to the environment, would provide specific recommendations of needed changes, and would assist us in the testing of the modified environment.<b>Skills</b>:        RFID,                     Antenna Design,                     RF Design,                     Electrical Engineering            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Expert-RFID-Engineer-with-significant-antenna-configuration-experience_%7E01c1428d3e4afd2c63?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:45.854Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 22, 2024 06:49 UTC","id":"01c1428d3e4afd2c63"},{"skillset":["Web Application","TypeScript","Node.js","JavaScript","Discord","Discord Bot Development","Server","Game Customization","Lua","FiveM","CMS Framework"],"title":"Fivem QB-Core developer - Upwork","description":"i have alot of bugs in my fivem city and need a dev to come and helpo resolve and make sure everything is installed correctly. we are just starting out and having major issues<b>Skills</b>:        Web Application,                     TypeScript,                     Node.js,                     JavaScript,                     Discord,                     Discord Bot Development,                     Server,                     Game Customization,                     Lua,                     FiveM,                     CMS Framework            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Fivem-Core-developer_%7E01e20cb86f0c52a696?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-19T08:48:45.854Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: February 22, 2024 01:49 UTC","id":"01e20cb86f0c52a696"},{"skillset":["Game Design","Game Development","Game Design Document","Prototyping"],"title":"Roblox Roleplay Game Designer/Programmer - Upwork","description":"We are seeking a talented individual who specializes in designing and programming Roblox roleplay games.

What I want is that only verified customers have access to this file on their private computer. If the customer wants to share this dotx-file with someone else, the customer won&#039;t succeed sharing or other users cannot use the file because of some restricting.\nTo be clear, the solution must be suitable for a dotx-file that has to be on the private machine of the user (otherwise Microsoft Word cannot use the dotx file). For both the private machine and the customer/user I have no control off. These users are working on their private machine.\nAlso, the solution doesn&#039;t have to be perfect, but still good enough that it&#039;s pretty hard to forward and/or use the dotx file on any other private machines.\nI have thought of 3 options to possibly solve this:\nOption 1: Perhaps there can be something developed with Powershell, or VSTO or just kind of Add-in for Word where the dotx-file is builtin and protected with some kind of mechanism. Perhaps MAC or IP address. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s possible.\nOption 2 is that you help me with building something I already build myself with PowerShell, but this is working for Windows computers only and still needs soms tweaks. I have no experience to create a script that does the same thing on MacOS.\nOption 3: The best thing would be that who wants to do this job for me, shows me a demo with just a blank dotx-file and how to restrict access to it. If I like the solution, I will buy this solution from you to apply it on my own dotx-file.\nI hope the solution I&#039;m looking for is clear.
