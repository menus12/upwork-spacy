[{"skillset":["Kajabi","Website Customization"],"title":"Expert Web Developer Needed: Enhance Font Implementation on Kajabi Platform - Upwork","description":"We are searching for a web developer proficient in Kajabi platform customization to assess and make changes to our current custom font implementation.\nThe task involves making crucial adjustments to guarantee consistency and coherence across our Kajabi account.\nOur primary aim is to seamlessly transition all font styles to default Kajabi fonts, while integrating custom fonts on several designated landing pages.\nCURRENT STATUS\nRight now we currently have custom code added within our Kajabi account for Headings, subheadings, and body fonts. Thus, these fonts are applying to ALL assets within our Kajabi site: main website pages (library, login, products, etc.) as well as all landing pages.\nWe only need custom fonts on 11 landing pages and instead we need default fonts on ALL other sites.\nWHAT WE NEED\nWe need eleven landing pages to have custom fonts &mdash; we need the integrity of the existing design w/ these fonts to stay in-tact. These pages SHOULD NOT be changed. If uploading custom code just into these individual pages, that&rsquo;s fine, but we need them to look the same as before removing the main fonts.\nWe then need the ability to use Kajabi&rsquo;s DEFAULT fonts on all Website pages and all future landing pages.\nWHAT WE ENVISION\nWe think this may be as simple as removing the existing code of the custom fonts and then RE-uploading those same exact fonts back in to the three individual websites that need the custom fonts.\nFrom there, since the main custom code was removed from our Kajabi site, then we could begin using the default fonts moving forward.\nSUMBIT ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:\n1. Are you clear on the solution we&rsquo;re seeking? If yes, please briefly summarize below.\n2. If removing coded fonts from the website and then into individual landing pages, how confident are you that you can keep the current design of the landing pages that need custom fonts?\n3. How quickly can you fix this for us?\nWhat additional information will you need from me to complete this?<b>Skills</b>:        Kajabi,                     Website Customization            ","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Expert-Web-Developer-Needed-Enhance-Font-Implementation-Kajabi-Platform_%7E0170f93df20ac80923?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T20:19:32.270Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 18, 2024 19:50 UTC","id":"0170f93df20ac80923"},{"skillset":[],"title":"Setting up New Music Site - Upwork","description":"I prefer to discuss your needs to start, hear basic mix.\nFile delivery - Protools session or all session files complete (FROM 0 ), .WAV / AIFF file format.\nAll session file uploads / downloads via Dropbox pro \nsession files as well as mixes will be listened to via dropbox.\nFinal Wave Mix / Master delivered after payment","link":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Setting-New-Music-Site_%7E013e71402971c44a64?source=rss","processedDate":"2024-03-18T20:19:32.270Z","postedDate":"<b>Posted On</b>: March 18, 2024 18:44 UTC","id":"013e71402971c44a64"},{"skillset":["Blockchain","JavaScript","Ethereum"],"title":"Looking for a web3 consultant w/ Blockchain Dev experience - Upwork","description":"Finish a project that ran over.

Read the Background section to fully understand what kind of data stuctures you&rsquo;re called to\nimplement. Do not start coding before you do that!\n2. Check to see if you have a tool to view PGM files. Open the provided image1.pgm with your\nfavorite image viewing application. Most applications support the PGM format. If not, download\nthe popular GIMP which is free and opensource. This is not a required step to complete this\nproject but it will help you a lot if you can visualize the images that you use as input / output.\n3. Read the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; section to avoid violations that can cost you many points.\n4. We recommend you work on the code in the following order:\n1. Utilities.loadData &ndash; you need to read an image file before you can do anything else\n2. class TreeNode &ndash; a simple node for the tree; requires minimal work\n3. class Queue &ndash; it&rsquo;s a generic queue that doesn&rsquo;t depend on quadtrees; it&rsquo;s not hard to\nimplement and you will need it later for the tree traversal anyway\n4. QuadTreeImage constructor &ndash; it creates the quadtree structure which is the basis for the\nother tree operations\n5. QuadTreeImage.countNodes &ndash; it&rsquo;s a low-hanging fruit and will quickly get you into the\ntree-traversal mood\n6. QuadTreeImage.brightness &ndash; it&rsquo;s a good practice of recursion before you attempt the\nsetColor method\n7. QuadTreeImage.getColor &ndash; it&rsquo;s a good practice of recursion before you attempt the\nsetColor method\n8. Utilities.exportImage &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy to implement with the use of getColor\n9. QuadTreeImage.compareTo &ndash; another low-hanging fruit\n10. QuadTreeImage.toString &ndash; although the level-order traversal is straight forward once\nyou implement the queue, this method has a small challenge; you must figure out how to\ninclude some extra data in the returned string\n11. The setColor is the most challenging method because it can trigger the restructuring of\nthe quadtree. Work on it after you&rsquo;re done with everything else.\nBackground\nA digital image with dimensions HxW is represented with a matrix of pixels that has H rows and W\ncolumns. In grayscale images, each pixel is an integer that takes values from 0-255 (i.e. 1 byte). A\nvalue of zero corresponds to the black color and a value of 255 corresponds to the white color.\nEverything in between is a tone of gray; the darker the gray the closer to 0, the lighter the gray the\ncloser to 255. Figure 2a depicts a zoom-in on a 16x12 grayscale image. In Figure 2b you can see the\nvalues of each pixel superimposed on the image.
